	url = {https://www.medrxiv.org/content/early/2022/05/03/2022.04.13.22273750},
	doi = {10.1101/2022.04.13.22273750},
	abstract = {There are thousands of distinct disease entities and concepts, each of which are known by different and sometimes contradictory names. The Monarch Initiative aims to integrate genotype, phenotype, and disease knowledge from a large variety of sources in support of improved diagnostics and mechanism discovery through various algorithms and tools. However, the lack of a unified system for managing disease entities poses a major challenge for both machines and humans to predict causes and treatments for disease. The multitude of disease resources have not been well coordinated nor computationally integrated. Furthermore, the classification of phenotypes and their association with diseases is another source of disagreement across sources. The Human Phenotype Ontology has helped to standardize phenotypic features across knowledge sources, but there was no equivalent computationally-harmonized disease ontology. To address these problems, a community of disease resources worked together to create the Mondo Disease Ontology as an open, community-driven ontology that integrates key medical and biomedical terminologies and is iteratively and regularly updated via manual curation and through synchronization with external sources using a Bayesian algorithm. Mondo supports disease data integration to improve diagnosis, treatment, and translational research. It records the sources of all data and is continually updated, making it suitable for research and clinical applications that require up-to-date disease knowledge.Evidence before this study Many disease terminologies currently exist, but there is not a definitive standard for encoding diseases while addressing requirements for information exchange. Existing sources of disease definitions include the National Cancer Institute Thesaurus (NCIt), the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), Orphanet, SNOMED CT, Disease Ontology (DO), ICD-10, MedGen, and numerous others. Each of these is designed for a particular purpose, and as such has different strengths. However, these standards only partially overlap and often conflict in the classification or mapping approach, making it difficult to align them with each other and/or with other knowledge sources. This need to integrate information has resulted in a proliferation of mappings between disease entries in different resources; these mappings lack completeness, accuracy, and precision, and are often inconsistent between resources.Added value of this study In order to computationally leverage the available knowledge sources for diagnostics and to reveal underlying mechanisms of diseases, we need to understand which terms are meaningfully equivalent across different resources. This will allow integration of associated information, such as treatments, genetics, phenotypes, etc. We therefore created the Mondo Disease Ontology to provide a logic-based structure for unifying multiple disease resources.Implications of all the available evidence Mondo can be leveraged by researchers and clinicians for disease annotations and data integration to aid in clinical diagnosis, treatment and advancement of human health care. Mondo is a freely available, open terminology that contains over 20,000 disease classes. Mondo is iteratively developed with contributions from the intended community and is under continuous revision, with future plans to further revise the top-level classes. Recently, efforts to classify rare diseases have centered on retrieving terms from various sources to provide a unified resource. Mondo can be explored using any of a variety of ontology browsers such as the Ontology Lookup Service (OLS) (ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mondo), and the ontology files and current releases are available on GitHub (github.com/monarch-initiative/mondo).Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementMondo is generously supported by the NIH National Human Genome Research Institute Phenomics First Resource, NIH-NHGRI ⋕ 1 RM1 HG010860-01, a Center of Excellence in Genomic Science; and an NIH Office of the Director Grant ⋕5R24OD011883 for the Monarch Initiative.

NGS results have traditionally been delivered in PDF format, and in some cases, structured data, e.g., XML or JSON formats, are also made available, but there is a lack of uniformity around the profiling of external vendor testing platforms. Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist and TriNetX have harmonized and mapped genomic data to FHIR Genomic standards and imported it into the TriNetX database through a data pipeline. This process is translatable to other sequencing platforms and to other institutions. The addition of genotypic data to the TriNetX database to the reservoir of phenotypic data will promote enhanced industry trial recruitment, (ii) comprehensive intra-institutional genomic benchmarking/quality improvement, and eventually (iii) sweeping inter-institutional genomic research and treatment paradigm shifts.},

Materials \& Methods A sample of 33 phenotype definitions used in research and published to the Phenotype KnowledgeBase (PheKB), that are represented using Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and Clinical Quality Language (CQL) was analyzed using automated analysis of the computable representation of the CQL libraries.
Results Most of the phenotype definitions include narrative descriptions and flowcharts, while few provide pseudocode or executable artifacts. Most use 4 or fewer medical terminologies. The number of codes used ranges from 5 to 6865, and value sets from 1 to 19. We found the most common expressions used were literal, data, and logical expressions. Aggregate and arithmetic expressions are the least common. Expression depth ranges from 4 to 27.
Discussion Despite the range of conditions, we found that all of the phenotype definitions consisted of logical criteria, representing both clinical and operational logic, and tabular data, consisting of codes from standard terminologies and keywords for natural language processing. The total number and variety of expressions is low, which may be to simplify implementation, or authors may limit complexity due to data availability constraints.
Conclusion The phenotypes analyzed show significant variation in specific logical, arithmetic and other operators, but are all composed of the same high-level components, namely tabular data and logical expressions. A standard representation for phenotype definitions should support these formats and be modular to support localization and shared logic.},

	url = {https://zenodo.org/record/6382431},
	doi = {10.5281/zenodo.6382431},
	abstract = {This scoping report represents a mission-oriented approach to supporting citizens' engagement and public trust in genomic data sharing, scoping out and suggesting possible approaches. It recognises from the outset that the issues of engagement and trust extend beyond the indispensable involvement of citizens to embrace a much wider range of stakeholders whose buy-in will also be essential to success. This review takes account of the B1MG and 1+MG, and aims to offer conceptual and practical steps for building on those achievements to bridge potential and actual benefits to science and society with a specific focus on citizens.   The rapid progress that has been made in genomics over the past two decades has created much debate (Boccia, 20141). On the one hand, genomics has the potential to deliver earlier diagnosis, more effective prevention programmes and more precise targeting of therapies, in some cases challenging our understanding of the nature of certain diseases. On the other hand, it raises a range of ethical, social and legal challenges (ELSI), including among other issues, protection and ownership of data, the need for care in interpreting data, potential misuse of data by commercial organisations, especially insurance companies, and questions about autonomy and the potential for stigma (National Research Council, 1988). As insights from genomics are increasingly used in clinical settings to inform personalised medicine, these ELSI considerations have been broadened, with many concerned this will widen existing inequalities in health care (Brothers \& Rothstein, 20152). While genetic testing may improve disease prediction, diagnosis, and treatment, the rapid uptake and application of genetics and genomics raise numerous ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSI). One of the most prominent among these is the growing number of possibilities of using genetic information to justify treating individuals differently or profiling specific population groups that may lead to genetic discrimination (GD) (Kim, 20213). The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is an important regulatory change at the EU level that has significant implications for the processing of genomic data in research and clinical practice. Recital 51 of the GDPR designates personal data which is, by its nature, particularly sensitive in relation to fundamental rights and freedoms as requiring specific protection, as the context of its processing could create significant risks to those fundamental rights and freedoms. Beside data generation and processing, ensuring data privacy and security requires robust infrastructure, training, as well as careful regulation of access. To capture the full benefits of genomic data, it must be shared with multiple actors, including: researchers to support academic and clinical research; health providers to support delivery of health services and public health activities; and commercial organisations involved in developing and implementing new health technologies or delivering health care services (Williams et al, 2021 4). Data sharing to facilitate greater genomic research and translation of findings into clinical use relies on the implementation of advanced technological solutions, health workers with the right skills and training to contribute to implementation, the active involvement of citizens and patients that support translation, and implementation of strong regulatory and governance procedures (Raza \& Hall, 20175). In this context, it is unavoidable to mention the concurrent COVID-19 pandemic, in view of the evolution of public awareness of science, as hopes have grown for vaccines and treatments to counter COVID-19. But this enhanced awareness carries corresponding responsibilities alongside the obvious potential benefits for mustering support for science. The pace of change, already increasingly rapid as science opens ever more doors to understanding of health, disease, diagnosis and treatment, has received dramatic new impetus through the exigencies of the COVID 19. Never in modern times has the population of the planet been subject to such a direct threat to health, and never have science and technology responded with such alacrity, energy and effectiveness. As the European Council secretariat explains in updating on progress towards an international agreement on pandemics, "the sharing of pathogens, biological samples and genomic data as well as the development of timely medical solutions (vaccines, treatments and diagnostics) are vital in order to enhance global pandemic preparedness." (https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/coronavirus/pandemic-treaty/) The corresponding leap in citizens' awareness and expectations of the world of science is however presenting a new dilemma: while health policy is encouraging and promoting (and indeed very largely depending on) science to solve the unprecedented challenge that COVID 19 presents, it also has to cater to the importance of bringing society along with developments, to foster understanding and to counter scepticism, suspicion, doubt and even hostility. This concern informs the European Parliament resolution on strengthening the fight against cancer, adopted by the plenary on 16 February 2022. It "encourages the Commission and the Member States to promote the knowledge of cancer biology through the implementation of genomics and informatics infrastructures; urges all implementation partners to be ever mindful of the principles of data privacy and security, trust, transparency, patient centricity and patient involvement at all times." (https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2022-0038\_EN.html) Against this background, it is prudent to consider the risk that the application of genome technology to healthcare, despite all its multiple potential benefits as a breakthrough in healthcare, could be confronted with similar turbulence and even negative opinion unless meticulous attention is paid to the challenges of gaining public understanding. Public understanding is vital in itself to gain trust on this data acquisition – but it is also an indispensable condition for obtaining the policy support that genomic medicine demands for implementing this ambitious project. At the heart of the 1+MG/B1MG concept is the collection and exchange of citizens' data. It is consequently implicit in the logic of the exercise that the interests of the citizens – whose data is to be collected and exchanged – should receive priority attention, even while solutions are found to the myriad technical, scientific, legal and political issues that the project also raises. This paper brings focus to this dilemma in European terms, scoping out both the potential and the challenges, and suggesting some approaches that can improve the chances of successful conciliation and mutual understanding between science and citizens – with the attendant benefits accruing to society as a whole.},

	abstract = {BackgroundAn essential step in any medical research project after identifying the research question is to determine if there are sufficient patients available for a study and where to find them. Pursuing digital feasibility queries on available patient data registries has proven to be an excellent way of reusing existing real-world data sources. To support multicentric research, these feasibility queries should be designed and implemented to run across multiple sites and securely access local data. Working across hospitals usually involves working with different data formats and vocabularies. Recently, the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard was developed by Health Level Seven to address this concern and describe patient data in a standardized format. The Medical Informatics Initiative in Germany has committed to this standard and created data integration centers, which convert existing data into the FHIR format at each hospital. This partially solves the interoperability problem; however, a distributed feasibility query platform for the FHIR standard is still missing.ObjectiveThis study described the design and implementation of the components involved in creating a cross-hospital feasibility query platform for researchers based on FHIR resources. This effort was part of a large COVID-19 data exchange platform and was designed to be scalable for a broad range of patient data.MethodsWe analyzed and designed the abstract components necessary for a distributed feasibility query. This included a user interface for creating the query, backend with an ontology and terminology service, middleware for query distribution, and FHIR feasibility query execution service.ResultsWe implemented the components described in the Methods section. The resulting solution was distributed to 33 German university hospitals. The functionality of the comprehensive network infrastructure was demonstrated using a test data set based on the German Corona Consensus Data Set. A performance test using specifically created synthetic data revealed the applicability of our solution to data sets containing millions of FHIR resources. The solution can be easily deployed across hospitals and supports feasibility queries, combining multiple inclusion and exclusion criteria using standard Health Level Seven query languages such as Clinical Quality Language and FHIR Search. Developing a platform based on multiple microservices allowed us to create an extendable platform and support multiple Health Level Seven query languages and middleware components to allow integration with future directions of the Medical Informatics Initiative.ConclusionsWe designed and implemented a feasibility platform for distributed feasibility queries, which works directly on FHIR-formatted data and distributed it across 33 university hospitals in Germany. We showed that developing a feasibility platform directly on the FHIR standard is feasible.},

We conducted a scoping review to identify trends and gaps in the use of FHIR for clinical research.Materials and methodsWe reviewed published literature, federally funded project databases, application websites, and other sources to discover FHIR-based papers, projects, and tools (collectively, "FHIR projects") available to support clinical research activities.ResultsOur search identified 203 different FHIR projects applicable to clinical research. Most were associated with preparations to conduct research, such as data mapping to and from FHIR formats (n = 66, 32.5\%) and managing ontologies with FHIR (n = 30, 14.8\%), or post-study data activities, such as sharing data using repositories or registries (n = 24, 11.8\%), general research data sharing (n = 23, 11.3\%), and management of genomic data (n = 21, 10.3\%). With the exception of phenotyping (n = 19, 9.4\%), fewer FHIR-based projects focused on needs within the clinical research process itself.DiscussionFunding and usage of FHIR-enabled solutions for research are expanding, but most projects appear focused on establishing data pipelines and linking clinical systems such as electronic health records, patient-facing data systems, and registries, possibly due to the relative newness of FHIR and the incentives for FHIR integration in health information systems. Fewer FHIR projects were associated with research-only activities.ConclusionThe FHIR standard is becoming an essential component of the clinical research enterprise. To develop FHIR's full potential for clinical research, funding and operational stakeholders should address gaps in FHIR-based research tools and methods.},

Experimental data have been generated on a huge number of organisms, tissue types, treatment conditions and disease states. The Gene Expression Omnibus ( Barrett et al., 2005), developed by the National Center for Bioinformatics (NCBI) at the National Institutes of Health is a repository of nearly 140 000 gene expression experiments. The BioConductor project (Gentleman et al., 2004) is an open-source and open-development software project built in the R statistical programming environment (R Development core Team, 2005) for the analysis and comprehension of genomic data. The tools contained in the BioConductor project represent many state-of-the-art methods for the analysis of microarray and genomics data. We have developed a software tool that allows access to the wealth of information within GEO directly from BioConductor, eliminating many the formatting and parsing problems that have made such analyses labor-intensive in the past. The software, called GEOquery, effectively establishes a bridge between GEO and BioConductor. Easy access to GEO data from BioConductor will likely lead to new analyses of GEO data using novel and rigorous statistical and bioinformatic tools.

Our database collects a range of information on each scRNA-seq analysis tool and categorises them according to the analysis tasks they perform. Exploration of this database gives insights into the areas of rapid development of analysis methods for scRNA-seq data. We see that many tools perform tasks specific to scRNA-seq analysis, particularly clustering and ordering of cells. We also find that the scRNA-seq community embraces an open-source and open-science approach, with most tools available under open-source licenses and preprints being extensively used as a means to describe methods.

The existing literature shows different methods to overcome this problem. Fast healthcare interoperable resources (FHIR) as a structural standard may explain other information models, (e.g., personal, physiological, and behavioral data from heterogeneous sources, such as activity sensors, questionnaires, and interviews) with semantic vocabularies, (e.g., Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine—Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT)) to connect personal health data to an electronic health record (EHR). We design and develop an intuitive health coaching (eCoach) smartphone application to prove the concept. We combine HL7 FHIR and SNOMED-CT vocabularies to exchange personal health data in JavaScript object notion (JSON). This study explores and analyzes our attempt to design and implement a structurally and logically compatible tethered personal health record (PHR) that allows bidirectional communication with an EHR. Our eCoach prototype implements most PHR-S FM functions as an interoperability quality standard. Its end-to-end (E2E) data are protected with a TSD (Services for Sensitive Data) security mechanism. We achieve 0\% data loss and 0\% unreliable performances during data transfer between PHR and EHR. Furthermore, this experimental study shows the effectiveness of FHIR modular resources toward flexible management of data components in the PHR (eCoach) prototype.},

	abstract = {Background: The standard Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is widely used in health information technology. However, its use as a standard for health research is still less prevalent. To use existing data sources more efficiently for health research, data interoperability becomes increasingly important. FHIR provides solutions by offering resource domains such as “Public Health \&amp; Research” and “Evidence-Based Medicine” while using already established web technologies. Therefore, FHIR could help standardize data across different data sources and improve interoperability in health research.
Objective: The aim of our study was to provide a systematic review of existing literature and determine the current state of FHIR implementations in health research and possible future directions.
Methods: We searched the PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and Cochrane Library databases for studies published from 2011 to 2022. Studies investigating the use of FHIR in health research were included. Articles published before 2011, abstracts, reviews, editorials, and expert opinions were excluded. We followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and registered this study with PROSPERO (CRD42021235393). Data synthesis was done in tables and figures.
Results: We identified a total of 998 studies, of which 49 studies were eligible for inclusion. Of the 49 studies, most (73\%, n=36) covered the domain of clinical research, whereas the remaining studies focused on public health or epidemiology (6\%, n=3) or did not specify their research domain (20\%, n=10). Studies used FHIR for data capture (29\%, n=14), standardization of data (41\%, n=20), analysis (12\%, n=6), recruitment (14\%, n=7), and consent management (4\%, n=2). Most (55\%, 27/49) of the studies had a generic approach, and 55\% (12/22) of the studies focusing on specific medical specialties (infectious disease, genomics, oncology, environmental health, imaging, and pulmonary hypertension) reported their solutions to be conferrable to other use cases. Most (63\%, 31/49) of the studies reported using additional data models or terminologies: Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (29\%, n=14), Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (37\%, n=18), International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (18\%, n=9), Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model (12\%, n=6), and others (43\%, n=21). Only 4 (8\%) studies used a FHIR resource from the domain “Public Health \&amp; Research.” Limitations using FHIR included the possible change in the content of FHIR resources, safety, legal matters, and the need for a FHIR server.
Conclusions: Our review found that FHIR can be implemented in health research, and the areas of application are broad and generalizable in most use cases. The implementation of international terminologies was common, and other standards such as the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model could be used as a complement to FHIR. Limitations such as the change of FHIR content, lack of FHIR implementation, safety, and legal matters need to be addressed in future releases to expand the use of FHIR and, therefore, interoperability in health research.},

	abstract = {Human biomedical datasets that are critical for research and clinical studies to benefit human health also often contain sensitive or potentially identifying information of individual participants. Thus, care must be taken when they are processed and made available to comply with ethical and regulatory frameworks and informed consent data conditions. To enable and streamline data access for these biomedical datasets, the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) Data Use and Researcher Identities (DURI) work stream developed and approved the Data Use Ontology (DUO) standard. DUO is a hierarchical vocabulary of human and machine-readable data use terms that consistently and unambiguously represents a dataset’s allowable data uses. DUO has been implemented by major international stakeholders such as the Broad and Sanger Institutes and is currently used in annotation of over 200,000 datasets worldwide. Using DUO in data management and access facilitates researchers’ discovery and access of relevant datasets. DUO annotations increase the FAIRness of datasets and support data linkages using common data use profiles when integrating the data for secondary analyses. DUO is implemented in the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and, to increase community awareness and engagement, hosted in an open, centralized GitHub repository. DUO, together with the GA4GH Passport standard, offers a new, efficient, and streamlined data authorization and access framework that has enabled increased sharing of biomedical datasets worldwide.},

	abstract = {The Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) supports international standards that enable a federated data sharing model for the research community while respecting data security, ethical and regulatory frameworks, and data authorization and access processes for sensitive data. The GA4GH Passport standard (Passport) defines a machine-readable digital identity that conveys roles and data access permissions (called “visas”) for individual users. Visas are issued by data stewards, including data access committees (DACs) working with public databases, the entities responsible for the quality, integrity, and access arrangements for the datasets in the management of human biomedical data. Passports streamline management of data access rights across data systems by using visas that present a data user’s digital identity and permissions across organizations, tools, environments, and services. We describe real-world implementations of the GA4GH Passport standard in use cases from ELIXIR Europe, National Institutes of Health, and the Autism Sharing Initiative. These implementations demonstrate that the Passport standard has provided transparent mechanisms for establishing permissions and authorizing data access across platforms.},

VRS provides semantically precise representations of variation and leverages this design to enable federated identification of biomolecular variation with globally consistent and unique computed identifiers. The VRS framework includes a terminology and information model, machine-readable schema, data sharing conventions, and a reference implementation, each of which is intended to be broadly useful and freely available for community use. VRS was developed by a partnership among national information resource providers, public initiatives, and diagnostic testing laboratories under the auspices of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH).},

The number of experiments based on sequencing technologies, in particular RNA-seq experiments, has been increasing over the last few years and submissions of sequencing data have overtaken microarray experiments in the last 12 months. Additionally, there is a significant increase in experiments investigating single cells, rather than bulk samples, known as single-cell RNA-seq. To accommodate these trends, we have substantially changed our submission tool Annotare which, along with raw and processed data, collects all metadata necessary to interpret these experiments. Selected datasets are re-processed and loaded into our sister resource, the value-added Expression Atlas (and its component Single Cell Expression Atlas), which not only enables users to interpret the data easily but also serves as a test for data quality. With an increasing number of studies that combine different assay modalities (multi-omics experiments), a new more general archival resource the BioStudies Database has been developed, which will eventually supersede ArrayExpress. Data submissions will continue unchanged; all existing ArrayExpress data will be incorporated into BioStudies and the existing accession numbers and application programming interfaces will be maintained.},

The DC tool is flexible and responsive, enabling legal and ethical requirements in research data sharing to be met and for online health information to be maintained. DC has been used in rare diseases and genomics, to enable people to control and express their preferences regarding their own data. However, DC has never been explored in relationship to historical collections of bioscientific and genetic heritage or to contexts involving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people (First Peoples of Australia).In response to the growing interest by First Peoples throughout Australia in genetic and genomic research, and the increasing number of invitations from researchers to participate in community health and wellbeing projects, this article examines the legal and ethical attributes and challenges of DC in these contexts. It also explores opportunities for including First Peoples' cultural perspectives, governance, and leadership as a method for defining (or redefining) DC on cultural terms that engage best practice research and data analysis as well as respect for meaningful and longitudinal individual and family participation.},

	abstract = {This article analyses the ethical and legal aspects of data-sharing and genomic research. It begins in Part II with an overview of the nature of genomic information, and whether it is exceptional when compared to other forms of health information. Part III considers the role of data-sharing in genomic research, with the importance of public trust in supporting genomic research considered in Part IV. The Australian regulatory framework for data-sharing in genomic research is considered in Parts V and VI, with reform options discussed in Part VII. The article concludes that advances in genomic research and the complexity of the current regulatory framework make it timely to review Australian laws to ensure that they maintain their relevance for this rapidly developing field of research.},

	title = {Genomic {Data} in {Australia}: {An} industry perspective on clarity, certainty and standardisation},
	abstract = {The collection, management and exchange of genomic data into healthcare delivery is critical to supporting better
person-centred care, driving value to the health system and to building a thriving research ecosystem. The delivery
of mature genomics information management which supports the integration of genomics into mainstream health
care requires a comprehensive and collaborative approach.
The genomics industry has an important role in delivering this maturity and ensuring that value is derived for all
stakeholders. With the establishment of the Industry Genomics Network Alliance (InGeNA) in 2020, it is now
appropriate to examine industry’s role in leveraging the value of genomic data to support better health outcomes
for Australians.
Engagement with stakeholders from industry, healthcare, research and consumers indicated three consistent
themes, being a need for clarity in how the sector communicates, certainty about regulatory and compliance
matters, and the importance of standards adoption to support the application of genomics to realise the value for
people, the healthcare sector and the research community.
As a united voice for the genomics industry, InGeNA has undertaken a review of the Australian genomic data
landscape to identify the challenges and opportunities evidence regarding the management, governance, sharing
and use of genomic data to support better outcomes for all Australians. This report then considers the role that
InGeNA can play in supporting the delivery of this potential.
By establishing shared positions regarding how genomic data is shared, managed and used in Australia, InGeNA
can engage with governments at all levels, and with professional bodies, consumer groups, research groups and
the broader healthcare sector to support and encourage the appropriate use of genomic data in Australia without
the perception of self-interest that any one organisation may attract. Indeed, the very diversity of interests among
the InGeNA membership ensures that a balanced and positive position can be found across a range of topics.
This report is intended primarily as an input to planning for InGeNA. However, it should also serve as a useful
guide to the value industry can bring to public health, research and the broader sector.},

	abstract = {A group of publishers came together to discuss how we could reduce the complexity and inconsistency provided in publisher's advice to researchers when selecting an appropriate data repository. It is a shared goal among publishers and other stakeholders to increase repository use – which remains far from optimal – and we assume that helping researchers find a suitable repository more easily will help achieve this. To address this a list of features has been created and it is intended only as a framework within which publishers can make recommendations to researchers, not as a way to restrict which repositories researchers may choose for their data. Our intention is that the features we highlight will act to initiate engagement and collaboration among publishers, repositories and the RPOs, government and funders that ultimately make the policies around Open Research. As we start this conversation, it is important that we act together with other stakeholders to raise awareness of the challenges involved around FAIR data and to prevent any perverse consequences. From the RDA FAIRsharing WG point of view, the ultimate objective is to map repository features across all existing initiatives, and to identify a common core set of metadata fields that all stakeholders want to see in registry of repositories. The FAIRsharing registry in particular is agnostic as to the selection process of standards, repositories and policies, as part of its commitment to working with and for all stakeholder groups.},

The main goal addressed by version 1 of the Beacon protocol was to test the feasibility of broadly sharing human genomic data, through providing simple “yes” or “no” responses to queries about the presence of a given variant in datasets hosted by Beacon providers. The popularity of this concept has fostered the design of a version 2, that better serves real-world requirements and addresses the needs of clinical genomics research and healthcare, as assessed by several contributing projects and organizations. Particularly, rare disease genetics and cancer research will benefit from new case level and genomic variant level requests and the enabling of richer phenotype and clinical queries as well as support for fuzzy searches. Beacon is designed as a “lingua franca” to bridge data collections hosted in software solutions with different and rich interfaces. Beacon version 2 works alongside popular standards like Phenopackets, OMOP, or FHIR, allowing implementing consortia to return matches in beacon responses and provide a handover to their preferred data exchange format. The protocol is being explored by other research domains and is being tested in several international projects.},

The Global Forum on Bioethics in Research (GFBR) convened in Stellenbosch, South Africa in November 2018, to explore the ethics of data sharing and biobanking in health research. Ninety-five participants from 35 countries drew on case studies and their experiences with sharing in their discussion of issues relating to respecting research participants and communities, promoting equitable sharing, and international and national approaches to governing data sharing and biobanking.

Beyond privacy laws, which only apply to genomic data that meets the definition of personal information, the key regulatory lever is the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) National Statement for Ethical Conduct in Human Research ("National Statement") (2007). Compliance with the National Statement is a requirement for institutions to apply to the NHMRC for funding, and includes-among other things-requirements for review of most genomic research by Human Research Ethics Committees. The sections of the National Statement specifying requirements for research with human genomic data are currently under review, including proposed new requirements addressing the return of genetic research findings and oversight of transfer agreements. Ensuring the willingness of Australians to donate their genomic information and participate in medical research will require clarification and harmonisation of the applicable regulatory framework, along with reforms to ensure that these regulations reflect the conditions necessary to promote ongoing public trust in researchers and institutions.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12874-016-0169-4},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Greater transparency and, in particular, sharing of patient-level data for further scientific research is an increasingly important topic for the pharmaceutical industry and other organisations who sponsor and conduct clinical trials as well as generally in the interests of patients participating in studies. A concern remains, however, over how to appropriately prepare and share clinical trial data with third party researchers, whilst maintaining patient confidentiality. Clinical trial datasets contain very detailed information on each participant. Risk to patient privacy can be mitigated by data reduction techniques. However, retention of data utility is important in order to allow meaningful scientific research. In addition, for clinical trial data, an excessive application of such techniques may pose a public health risk if misleading results are produced. After considering existing guidance, this article makes recommendations with the aim of promoting an approach that balances data utility and privacy risk and is applicable across clinical trial data holders. DISCUSSION: Our key recommendations are as follows: 1. Data anonymisation/de-identification: Data holders are responsible for generating de-identified datasets which are intended to offer increased protection for patient privacy through masking or generalisation of direct and some indirect identifiers. 2. Controlled access to data, including use of a data sharing agreement: A legally binding data sharing agreement should be in place, including agreements not to download or further share data and not to attempt to seek to identify patients. Appropriate levels of security should be used for transferring data or providing access; one solution is use of a secure 'locked box' system which provides additional safeguards. This article provides recommendations on best practices to de-identify/anonymise clinical trial data for sharing with third-party researchers, as well as controlled access to data and data sharing agreements. The recommendations are applicable to all clinical trial data holders. Further work will be needed to identify and evaluate competing possibilities as regulations, attitudes to risk and technologies evolve.},

At the same time, citizens have different expectations and fears about that data sharing. International legislation in relation with research ethics and practice and, particularly, data protection create a particular environment that, as is seen in the articles in part two of this special issue, are crying out for harmonisation both at a procedural but at fundamental conceptual levels. The law of data sharing is pulling in different directions. This paper poses the question, 'harmonisation, an impossible dream?' and the answer is a qualified 'no'. The paper reflects on what can be seen in the papers in part two of the special issue. It then identifies three major areas of conceptual uncertainty in the new EU General Data Protection Regulation (not because it has superiority over other jurisdictions, but because it is a recent revision of data protection law that leaves universal conceptual questions unclear). Thereafter, the potential for Artificial Intelligence to meet some of the shortcomings is discussed. The paper ends with a consideration of the conditions under which data sharing harmonisation might be achieved: an understanding of a human rights approach and citizen sensitivities in considering the 'public interest'; social liberalism as a basis of solidarity; and the profession of 'researcher'.},

We evaluated data availability in research articles across nine disciplines in Nature and Science magazines and recorded corresponding authors' concerns, requests and reasons for declining data sharing. Although data sharing has improved in the last decade and particularly in recent years, data availability and willingness to share data still differ greatly among disciplines. We observed that statements of data availability upon (reasonable) request are inefficient and should not be allowed by journals. To improve data sharing at the time of manuscript acceptance, researchers should be better motivated to release their data with real benefits such as recognition, or bonus points in grant and job applications. We recommend that data management costs should be covered by funding agencies; publicly available research data ought to be included in the evaluation of applications; and surveillance of data sharing should be enforced by both academic publishers and funders.

Most of these efforts have focused on issues in the context of genomic sequence data, but the popularity of techniques for collecting other types of genome-related data has prompted researchers to investigate privacy concerns in a broader genomic context. In this review, we give an overview of different types of genome-associated data, their individual ways of revealing sensitive information, the motivation to share them as well as established and upcoming methods to minimize information leakage. We further discuss the concise threats that are being posed, who is at risk, and how the risk level compares to potential benefits, all while addressing the topic in the context of modern technology, methodology, and information sharing culture. Additionally, we will discuss the current legal situation regarding the sharing of genomic data in a selection of countries, evaluating the scope of their applicability as well as their limitations. We will finalize this review by evaluating the development that is required in the scientific field in the near future in order to improve and develop privacy-preserving data sharing techniques for the genomic context.

	abstract = {Canada's regulatory frameworks governing privacy and research are generally permissive of genomic data sharing, though they may soon be tightened in response to public concerns over commercial data handling practices and the strengthening of influential European privacy laws. Regulation can seem complex and uncertain, in part because of the constitutional division of power between federal and provincial governments over both privacy and health care. Broad consent is commonly practiced in genomic research, but without explicit regulatory recognition, it is often scrutinized by research or privacy oversight bodies. Secondary use of health-care data is legally permissible under limited circumstances. A new federal law prohibits genetic discrimination, but is subject to a constitutional challenge. Privacy laws require security safeguards proportionate to the data sensitivity, including breach notification. Special categories of data are not defined a priori. With some exceptions, Canadian researchers are permitted to share personal information internationally but are held accountable for safeguarding the privacy and security of these data. Cloud computing to store and share large scale data sets is permitted, if shared responsibilities for access, responsible use, and security are carefully articulated. For the moment, Canada's commercial sector is recognized as "adequate" by Europe, facilitating import of European data. Maintaining adequacy status under the new European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a concern because of Canada's weaker individual rights, privacy protections, and regulatory enforcement. Researchers must stay attuned to shifting international and national regulations to ensure a sustainable future for responsible genomic data sharing.},

	abstract = {The evolution of genomic research and its integration into clinical practice, as they become international-even global-endeavors, has brought us to a place where scientists and clinicians may now only ignore the rules governing international data sharing at their own peril. Open data policies, on the one hand, increasingly require custodians of others' genomic data to make it as widely available as feasible, including to researchers in other countries. Data protection law, on the other, has become a significant hurdle to the sharing of personal data across jurisdictional borders. The space between these two competing duties is narrowing. In contrast with the other texts in this volume, which explore the present and future of data sharing and data protection, this article's focus is on the past. It centres on the historical development of the data protection rules regarding the international transfer of personal data up to the present. The article's aim is to bring into focus the underlying objectives that have influenced and that will continue to influence the way that data protection rules are applied to the fields of genomics and health, as well as future developments in data protection generally. The first part of this article describes the development of international data-sharing data protection rules since 1970. The second considers difficulties in applying general data protection rules to the specific context of genomics and health. The third and final part compares the options available to comply with the international transfer restrictions set out in the standard-setting EU General Data Protection Regulation from a genomics perspective.},

Juni 2017, BGBl. 2017 I p. 2097 et seq.). Despite being directly binding on all EU member states, the GDPR does not render national data protection provision obsolete-they are covered by the GDPR's opening clauses which include regulatory mandates and room for derogation. This creates considerable need for national legislative adaptation. Art. 1 DSAnpUG-EU contains the necessary amendments to the Federal Data Protection Law (BDSG(neu)), thus creating the second major building block of future German data protection alongside the GDPR itself. Nevertheless, there are still numerous sector-specific regulations in other federal laws and the data protection laws of the 16 states also need amendments. Adjustment in Germany is well on its way, but implementation in general is still ongoing, with further consequences for data processing and sharing.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Large-scale linkage of international clinical datasets could lead to unique insights into disease aetiology and facilitate treatment evaluation and drug development. Hereto, multi-stakeholder consortia are currently designing several disease-specific translational research platforms to enable international health data sharing. Despite the recent adoption of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the procedures for how to govern responsible data sharing in such projects are not at all spelled out yet. In search of a first, basic outline of an ethical governance framework, we set out to explore relevant ethical principles and norms. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of literature and ethical guidelines for principles and norms pertaining to data sharing for international health research. RESULTS: We observed an abundance of principles and norms with considerable convergence at the aggregate level of four overarching themes: societal benefits and value; distribution of risks, benefits and burdens; respect for individuals and groups; and public trust and engagement. However, at the level of principles and norms we identified substantial variation in the phrasing and level of detail, the number and content of norms considered necessary to protect a principle, and the contextual approaches in which principles and norms are used. CONCLUSIONS: While providing some helpful leads for further work on a coherent governance framework for data sharing, the current collection of principles and norms prompts important questions about how to streamline terminology regarding de-identification and how to harmonise the identified principles and norms into a coherent governance framework that promotes data sharing while securing public trust.},

Fast, reciprocal data exchange was fully established between sister Biosample databases and other INSDC partners, enabling a worldwide common representation and centralization of sample metadata. The BioSamples platform has been upgraded to accommodate anticipated increases in the number of submissions via GA4GH driver projects such as the Human Cell Atlas and the EGA, as well as from mirroring of NCBI dbGaP data. The BioSamples database is now the authoritative repository for all INSDC sample metadata, an ELIXIR Deposition Database for Biomolecular Data and the EMBL-EBI sample metadata hub. To support faster turnaround for sample submission, and to increase scalability and resilience, we have upgraded the BioSamples database backend storage, APIs and user interface. Finally, the website has been redesigned to allow search and retrieval of records based on specific filters, such as ‘disease’ or ‘organism’. These changes are targeted at answering current use cases as well as providing functionalities for future emerging and anticipated developments.
