	abstract = {The complexities of the informed consent process for participating in research in genomic medicine are well-documented. Inspired by the potential for Dynamic Consent to increase participant choice and autonomy in decision-making, as well as the opportunities for ongoing participant engagement it affords, we wanted to trial Dynamic Consent and to do so developed our own web-based application (web app) called CTRL (control). This paper documents the design and development of CTRL, for use in the Australian Genomics study: a health services research project building evidence to inform the integration of genomic medicine into mainstream healthcare. Australian Genomics brought together a multi-disciplinary team to develop CTRL. The design and development process considered user experience; security and privacy; the application of international standards in data sharing; IT, operational and ethical issues. The CTRL tool is now being offered to participants in the study, who can use CTRL to keep personal and contact details up to date; make consent choices (including indicate preferences for return of results and future research use of biological samples, genomic and health data); follow their progress through the study; complete surveys, contact the researchers and access study news and information. While there are remaining challenges to implementing Dynamic Consent in genomic research, this study demonstrates the feasibility of building such a tool, and its ongoing use will provide evidence about the value of Dynamic Consent in large-scale genomic research programs.},

We present a crude model for estimating the rate of healthcare-funded genomes worldwide that accounts for the preparedness of each country for genomics, and infers a progression of cancer-related sequencing over time. We estimate that over 60 million patients will have their genome sequenced in a healthcare context by 2025. This represents a large technical challenge for healthcare systems, and a huge opportunity for research. We identify eight major practical, principled arguments to support the position that virtual cohorts of 100 million people or more would have tangible research benefits.},

The metadata crosswalk is the foundation of data provision between a Medical Data Integration Center (MeDIC) and researchers, providing a selection of metadata information for research design and requests. Based on the crosswalk, metadata items were prioritized and categorized to demonstrate that not one single predefined standard meets all requirements of a MeDIC and only a maximum data set of metadata is suitable for use. The development of a convergence format including the maximum data set is the anticipated solution for an automated transformation of metadata in a MeDIC.},

HostSeq is a collaboration among 13 independent epidemiological studies of SARS-CoV-2 across five provinces in Canada. Aggregated data collected by HostSeq are made available to the public through two data portals: a phenotype portal showing summaries of major variables and their distributions, and a variant search portal enabling queries in a genomic region. Individual-level data is available to the global research community for health research through a Data Access Agreement and Data Access Compliance Office approval. Here we provide an overview of the collective project design along with summary level information for HostSeq. We highlight several statistical considerations for researchers using the HostSeq platform regarding data aggregation, sampling mechanism, covariate adjustment, and X chromosome analysis. In addition to serving as a rich data source, the diversity of study designs, sample sizes, and research objectives among the participating studies provides unique opportunities for the research community.},

	doi = {10.2196/37236},
	abstract = {In this viewpoint, we argue for the importance of creating data spaces for genomic research that are detached from contexts in which fundamental rights concerns related to surveillance measures override a purpose-specific balancing of fundamental rights. Genomic research relies on molecular and phenotypic data, on comparing findings within large data sets, on searchable metadata, and on translating research results into a clinical setting. These methods require sensitive genetic and health data to be shared across borders. International data sharing between the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area and third countries has accordingly become a cornerstone of genomics. The EU General Data Protection Regulation contains rules that accord privileged status to data processing for research purposes to ensure that strict data protection requirements do not impede biomedical research. However, the General Data Protection Regulation rules applicable to international transfers of data accord no such preferential treatment to international data transfers made in the research context. The rules that govern the international transfer of data create considerable barriers to international data sharing because of the cost-intensive procedural and substantive compliance burdens that they impose. For certain jurisdictions and select use cases, there exist practically no lawful mechanisms to enable the international transfer of data because of concerns about the protection of fundamental rights. The proposed solutions further fail to address the need to share large data sets of local and regional cohorts across national borders to enable joint analyses. The European Health Data Space is an emerging federated, EU-wide data infrastructure that is intended to function as an infrastructure bringing together EU health data to improve patient care and enable the secondary use of health-related data for research purposes. Such infrastructure is implementing new institutions to support its functioning and is being implemented in reliance on a new enabling law, the regulation on the European Health Data Space. This innovation provides the opportunity to facilitate EU contribution to international genomic research efforts. The draft regulation for this data space provides for a concept of data infrastructure intended to enable cross-border data exchange and access, including access to genetic and health data for scientific analysis purposes. The draft regulation also provides for obligations of national actors aimed at making data widely available. This effort is laudable. However, in the absence of further, more fundamental changes to the manner in which the EU regulates the secondary use of health data, it is reasonable to believe that EU participation in international genomic research efforts will remain impeded.},

One source of this controversy is that the GDPR requires consent to process personal data to be clear, concise, specific and granular, freely given and revocable and therefore has challenged the concept of ‘broad consent’, which has been widely applied in the context of biobanking. Another source of controversy is the interplay between regulations of research ethics and protection of personal data related to the secondary use of personal data and biological materials. In this case, the GDPR ‘research condition’ provides an alternative to re-consent for the use of previously collected personal data and biological materials. Although the mentioned controversies have been raised in the legal literature, they have not been explicitly addressed from the research ethics perspective. Should consent be regarded as a priority legal basis for personal data processing in health data research? Can broad consent still be a suitable legal ground for biobanking? What should be the role of research ethics provisions that differ from the GDPR standards, and what should be the role and function of research ethics committees in the changing environment of health data research? These are the ongoing controversies to be explored in the paper.},

	abstract = {BackgroundThe legal framework for clinical research in the EU is complex and the lack of harmonization of the relevant legal and ethical rules remains one of the main challenges for stakeholders in the field. The recently adopted Data Governance Act (DGA) and the proposal for a European Health Data Space (EHDS) promise to solve the existing challenges with respect to access to and (re)use of personal data for research, but also risk to further complexify the field. The DGA introduced a novel mechanism – data altruism. Data altruism is understood as the voluntary sharing of personal and non-personal data, based on the consent of data subjects or the permission of natural and legal persons, without seeking a reward and for objectives of general interest. This study aimed to gain insights into the opinion of clinical research stakeholders on data altruism, and to critically discuss key issues pertaining to the application of data altruism from a legal point of view.MethodsSemi-structured interviews with (1) data protection officers (DPOs) and legal experts working with commercial and academic sponsors of clinical trials, (2) investigators, and (3) members of research ethics committees. Data underwent framework analysis. The legal discussion was comprised of legal doctrinal research with focus on the DGA, EHDS proposal, and the interplay with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).ResultsFourteen experts took part in the interviews, more than half of which were DPOs/legal experts. Interviewees were based in seven EU Member states and the United Kingdom. The majority of participants were critical towards the data altruism mechanism and pointed out challenges and risks associated with its application.ConclusionAlthough data altruism holds the potential to facilitate data sharing, its application in clinical research at the moment is still riddled with uncertainties. The interplay of the DGA rules with the provisions of the GDPR and the EHDS proposal are insufficiently clear and further efforts from the legislator are required to build a working, patient-centered, and research fostering data altruism system.},

The partners on the project represent many of the largest human genome sequencing and analysis efforts in Australia. Currently there is no way to identify virtual cohorts of individuals who have had their genomes sequenced nationally as it is not possible to query across the separate assets from each participating genomics repository. This work aims to implement a system that can be used to identify cohorts of individuals and related data assets across the repositories located at each of the partner institutes (i.e., UMCCR/Australian Genomics, QIMRB, ZERO/CCIA, Garvan and NCI) The initial focus of the virtual cohorts sub-project within the HGPP was a knowledge discovery and recording phase to define: the current state of cross-institutional human genomic data querying in Australia the set of problems that need to be addressed  key stakeholders and their (likely) requirements. As such, this document records: the current state of processes and tools for virtual cohort querying national community needs candidate solutions to enable cross-institutional virtual cohort querying recommendations on preferred technology and proposed implementation architecture This document will be used as a reference to plan the pilot for a system that addresses prioritised requirements to create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The primary audiences for this document include the HGPP sub-project team, other HGPP stakeholders, and the project reference group.},

	abstract = {Beacon is a basic data discovery protocol issued by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH). The main goal addressed by version 1 of the Beacon protocol was to test the feasibility of broadly sharing human genomic data, through providing simple “yes” or “no” responses to queries about the presence of a given variant in datasets hosted by Beacon providers. The popularity of this concept has fostered the design of a version 2, that better serves real-world requirements and addresses the needs of clinical genomics research and healthcare, as assessed by several contributing projects and organizations. Particularly, rare disease genetics and cancer research will benefit from new case level and genomic variant level requests and the enabling of richer phenotype and clinical queries as well as support for fuzzy searches. Beacon is designed as a “lingua franca” to bridge data collections hosted in software solutions with different and rich interfaces. Beacon version 2 works alongside popular standards like Phenopackets, OMOP, or FHIR, allowing implementing consortia to return matches in beacon responses and provide a handover to their preferred data exchange format. The protocol is being explored by other research domains and is being tested in several international projects.},

	abstract = {Diagnostic genomic sequencing generates unprecedented amounts of data. In addition to its primary use, this data could be used for a wide range of secondary purposes, including research and informing future healthcare for the data donor. These opportunities may require data to be shared with third parties. Although effective data sharing relies on public support, there are barriers which may prevent people from choosing to donate their genomic data and surprisingly few studies explore these barriers in depth. To address this need, this study aimed to qualitatively explore the Australian public's views and preferences for storing and sharing genomic data. Online focus groups were recorded, transcribed, and analysed using inductive content analysis. A total of 7 focus groups were conducted with 39 members of the Australian public ranging from 18 to 67 years of age. Participants were mostly supportive of genomic data being stored and shared for secondary purposes, recognising the potential benefits for individual health and wider medical research. However, some concerns were identified. Participants felt genomic data was particularly sensitive information, and raised the potential for discrimination, stigma, and other malicious uses of such data. Concerns for privacy and security of the data were also prevalent. Trustworthiness of data users was important when considering who genomic data should be shared with. Although participants were supportive of data being freely available to health professionals and researchers, they were opposed to insurance companies and employers accessing the data. There was greater controversy around sharing data with law enforcement and pharmaceutical companies. Participants recognised both benefits and harms to sharing with law enforcement. They were also cognizant of the dual purpose of pharmaceutical companies as both research and profit-driven organisations. Finally, participants expressed varying perspectives about sharing genomic data with family members, yet most agreed that explicit consent from the data donor should be required to share their information with relatives. This study highlighted several of the Australian public's perceived barriers and motivators for the storage and sharing of genomic data. Participants recognised both the benefits of collecting, storing and sharing such data widely but also the potential for harm from data misuse. While public acceptance of such endeavours is required to maximise the volume of data made available, the concerns around data access and security need to be addressed before this can occur. These findings also highlight the nuance and ethical complexity of decisions about who we should allow to access donated genomic data. These perspectives will be essential in helping to shape the way large-scale genomic data storage and sharing is developed and implemented in Australia, and internationally.},

Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist and TriNetX have harmonized and mapped genomic data to FHIR Genomic standards and imported it into the TriNetX database through a data pipeline. This process is translatable to other sequencing platforms and to other institutions.

Beyond technologies, routine adoption of precision medicine in clinical practice requires social, ethical, legal and regulatory barriers to be addressed.

	abstract = {For the first time in Europe hundreds of rare disease (RD) experts team up to actively share and jointly analyse existing patient’s data. Solve-RD is a Horizon 2020-supported EU flagship project bringing together {\textgreater}300 clinicians, scientists, and patient representatives of 51 sites from 15 countries. Solve-RD is built upon a core group of four European Reference Networks (ERNs; ERN-ITHACA, ERN-RND, ERN-Euro NMD, ERN-GENTURIS) which annually see more than 270,000 RD patients with respective pathologies. The main ambition is to solve unsolved rare diseases for which a molecular cause is not yet known. This is achieved through an innovative clinical research environment that introduces novel ways to organise expertise and data. Two major approaches are being pursued (i) massive data re-analysis of {\textgreater}19,000 unsolved rare disease patients and (ii) novel combined -omics approaches. The minimum requirement to be eligible for the analysis activities is an inconclusive exome that can be shared with controlled access. The first preliminary data re-analysis has already diagnosed 255 cases form 8393 exomes/genome datasets. This unprecedented degree of collaboration focused on sharing of data and expertise shall identify many new disease genes and enable diagnosis of many so far undiagnosed patients from all over Europe.},

	abstract = {Rare disease patients are more likely to receive a rapid molecular diagnosis nowadays thanks to the wide adoption of next-generation sequencing. However, many cases remain undiagnosed even after exome or genome analysis, because the methods used missed the molecular cause in a known gene, or a novel causative gene could not be identified and/or confirmed. To address these challenges, the RD-Connect Genome-Phenome Analysis Platform (GPAP) facilitates the collation, discovery, sharing, and analysis of standardized genome-phenome data within a collaborative environment. Authorized clinicians and researchers submit pseudonymised phenotypic profiles encoded using the Human Phenotype Ontology, and raw genomic data which is processed through a standardized pipeline. After an optional embargo period, the data are shared with other platform users, with the objective that similar cases in the system and queries from peers may help diagnose the case. Additionally, the platform enables bidirectional discovery of similar cases in other databases from the Matchmaker Exchange network. To facilitate genome-phenome analysis and interpretation by clinical researchers, the RD-Connect GPAP provides a powerful user-friendly interface and leverages tens of information sources. As a result, the resource has already helped diagnose hundreds of rare disease patients and discover new disease causing genes.},

	abstract = {There are few better examples of the need for data sharing than in the rare disease community, where patients, physicians, and researchers must search for “the needle in a haystack” to uncover rare, novel causes of disease within the genome. Impeding the pace of discovery has been the existence of many small siloed datasets within individual research or clinical laboratory databases and/or disease-specific organizations, hoping for serendipitous occasions when two distant investigators happen to learn they have a rare phenotype in common and can “match” these cases to build evidence for causality. However, serendipity has never proven to be a reliable or scalable approach in science. As such, the Matchmaker Exchange (MME) was launched to provide a robust and systematic approach to rare disease gene discovery through the creation of a federated network connecting databases of genotypes and rare phenotypes using a common application programming interface (API). The core building blocks of the MME have been defined and assembled. Three MME services have now been connected through the API and are available for community use. Additional databases that support internal matching are anticipated to join the MME network as it continues to grow.},

We analyse the MGRB for single-nucleotide, indel and structural variation in the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. MGRB individuals have fewer disease-associated common and rare germline variants, relative to both cancer cases and the gnomAD and UK Biobank cohorts, consistent with risk depletion. Age-related somatic changes are correlated with grip strength in men, suggesting blood-derived whole genomes may also provide a biologic measure of age-related functional deterioration. The MGRB provides a broadly applicable reference cohort for clinical genetics and genomic association studies, and for understanding the genetics of healthy ageing.},

Concomitantly, the proliferation of 3D imaging techniques for cells, tissues and organisms using volume EM (vEM) and X-ray tomography (XT) led to calls from these communities to publicly archive such data as well. EMPIAR (empiar.org) was developed as a public archive for raw cryo-EM image data and for 3D reconstructions from vEM and XT experiments and now comprises over a thousand entries totalling over 2 petabytes of data. EMPIAR resources include a deposition system, entry pages, facilities to search, visualise and download datasets, and a REST API for programmatic access to entry metadata. The success of EMPIAR also poses significant challenges for the future in dealing with the very fast growth in the volume of data and in enhancing its reusability.},

	abstract = {There are inherent complexities and tensions in achieving a responsible balance between safeguarding patients’ privacy and sharing genomic data for advancing health and medical science. A growing body of literature suggests establishing patient genomic data ownership, enabled by blockchain technology, as one approach for managing these priorities. We conducted an online survey, applying a mixed methods approach to collect quantitative (using scale questions) and qualitative data (using open-ended questions). We explored the views of 117 genomic professionals (clinical geneticists, genetic counsellors, bioinformaticians, and researchers) towards patient data ownership in Australia. Data analysis revealed most professionals agreed that patients have rights to data ownership. However, there is a need for a clearer understanding of the nature and implications of data ownership in this context as genomic data often is subject to collective ownership (e.g., with family members and laboratories). This research finds that while the majority of genomic professionals acknowledge the desire for patient data ownership, bioinformaticians and researchers expressed more favourable views than clinical geneticists and genetic counsellors, suggesting that their views on this issue may be shaped by how closely they interact with patients as part of their professional duties. This research also confirms that stronger health system infrastructure is a prerequisite for enabling patient data ownership, which needs to be underpinned by appropriate digital infrastructure (e.g., central vs. decentralised data storage), patient identity ownership (e.g., limited vs. self-sovereign identity), and policy at both federal and state levels.},

	abstract = {Genomic researchers are increasingly utilizing commercial cloud platforms (CCPs) to manage their data and analytics needs. Commercial clouds allow researchers to grow their storage and analytics capacity on demand, keeping pace with expanding project data footprints and enabling researchers to avoid large capital expenditures while paying only for IT capacity consumed by their project. Cloud computing also allows researchers to overcome common network and storage bottlenecks encountered when combining or re-analysing large datasets. However, cloud computing presents a new set of challenges. Without adequate security controls, the risk of unauthorised access may be higher for data stored on the cloud. In addition, regulators are increasingly mandating data access patterns and specific security protocols on the storage and use of genomic data to safeguard rights of the study participants. While CCPs provide tools for security and regulatory compliance, utilising these tools to build the necessary controls required for cloud solutions is not trivial as such skill sets are not commonly found in a genomics lab. The Research Assets Provisioning and Tracking Online Repository (RAPTOR) by the Genome Institute of Singapore is a cloud native genomics data repository and analytics platform focusing on security and regulatory compliance. Using a “five-safes” framework (Safe Purpose, Safe People, Safe Settings, Safe Data and Safe Output), RAPTOR provides security and governance controls to data contributors and users leveraging cloud computing for sharing and analysis of large genomic datasets without the risk of security breaches or running afoul of regulations. RAPTOR can also enable data federation with other genomic data repositories using GA4GH community-defined standards, allowing researchers to boost the statistical power of their work and overcome geographic and ancestry limitations of data sets},

	abstract = {Large electronic databases of health care information, such as administrative claims and electronic health records, are available and are being used in a number of public health settings, including drug safety surveillance. However, because of a lack of standardization, clinical terminologies may differ across databases. With the aid of existing resources and expert coders, we have developed mapping tables to convert ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes used in some existing databases to SNOMED-CT and MedDRA. In addition, previously developed definitions for specific health outcomes of interest were mapped to the same standardized vocabularies. We evaluated how vocabulary mapping affected (1) the retention of clinical data from two test databases, (2) the semantic space of outcome definitions, (3) the prevalence of each outcome in the test databases, and (4) the reliability of analytic methods designed to detect drug-outcome associations in the test databases. Although vocabulary mapping affected the semantic space of some outcome definitions, as well as the prevalence of some outcomes in the test databases, it had only minor effects on the analysis of drug-outcome associations. Furthermore, both SNOMED-CT and MedDRA were viable for use as standardized vocabularies in systems designed to perform active medical product surveillance using disparate sources of observational data.},

	abstract = {Data sharing is considered a crucial part of modern medical research. Unfortunately, despite its advantages, it often faces obstacles, especially data privacy challenges. As a result, various approaches and infrastructures have been developed that aim to ensure that patients and research participants remain anonymous when data is shared. However, privacy protection typically comes at a cost, e.g. restrictions regarding the types of analyses that can be performed on shared data. What is lacking is a systematization making the trade-offs taken by different approaches transparent. The aim of the work described in this paper was to develop a systematization for the degree of privacy protection provided and the trade-offs taken by different data sharing methods. Based on this contribution, we categorized popular data sharing approaches and identified research gaps by analyzing combinations of promising properties and features that are not yet supported by existing approaches.},

	abstract = {Objective
To evaluate common data models (CDMs) to determine which is best suited for sharing data from a large, longitudinal, electronic health record (EHR)-based community registry.
Materials and methods
Four CDMs were chosen from models in use for clinical research data: Sentinel v5.0 (referred to as the Mini-Sentinel CDM in previous versions), PCORnet v3.0 (an extension of the Mini-Sentinel CDM), OMOP v5.0, and CDISC SDTM v1.4. Each model was evaluated against 11 criteria adapted from previous research. The criteria fell into six categories: content coverage, integrity, flexibility, ease of querying, standards compatibility, and ease and extent of implementation.
Results
The OMOP CDM accommodated the highest percentage of our data elements (76\%), fared well on other requirements, and had broader terminology coverage than the other models. Sentinel and PCORnet fell short in content coverage with 37\% and 48\% matches respectively. Although SDTM accommodated a significant percentage of data elements (55\% true matches), 45\% of the data elements mapped to SDTM’s extension mechanism, known as Supplemental Qualifiers, increasing the number of joins required to query the data.
Conclusion
The OMOP CDM best met the criteria for supporting data sharing from longitudinal EHR-based studies. Conclusions may differ for other uses and associated data element sets, but the methodology reported here is easily adaptable to common data model evaluation for other uses.},

	abstract = {Underrepresentation of Asian genomes has hindered population and medical genetics research on Asians, leading to population disparities in precision medicine. By whole-genome sequencing of 4,810 Singapore Chinese, Malays, and Indians, we found 98.3 million SNPs and small insertions or deletions, over half of which are novel. Population structure analysis demonstrated great representation of Asian genetic diversity by three ethnicities in Singapore and revealed a Malay-related novel ancestry component. Furthermore, demographic inference suggested that Malays split from Chinese ∼24,800 years ago and experienced significant admixture with East Asians ∼1,700 years ago, coinciding with the Austronesian expansion. Additionally, we identified 20 candidate loci for natural selection, 14 of which harbored robust associations with complex traits and diseases. Finally, we show that our data can substantially improve genotype imputation in diverse Asian and Oceanian populations. These results highlight the value of our data as a resource to empower human genetics discovery across broad geographic regions.},

	doi = {10.1101/2022.04.13.22273750},
	abstract = {There are thousands of distinct disease entities and concepts, each of which are known by different and sometimes contradictory names. The Monarch Initiative aims to integrate genotype, phenotype, and disease knowledge from a large variety of sources in support of improved diagnostics and mechanism discovery through various algorithms and tools. However, the lack of a unified system for managing disease entities poses a major challenge for both machines and humans to predict causes and treatments for disease. The multitude of disease resources have not been well coordinated nor computationally integrated. Furthermore, the classification of phenotypes and their association with diseases is another source of disagreement across sources. The Human Phenotype Ontology has helped to standardize phenotypic features across knowledge sources, but there was no equivalent computationally-harmonized disease ontology. To address these problems, a community of disease resources worked together to create the Mondo Disease Ontology as an open, community-driven ontology that integrates key medical and biomedical terminologies and is iteratively and regularly updated via manual curation and through synchronization with external sources using a Bayesian algorithm. Mondo supports disease data integration to improve diagnosis, treatment, and translational research. It records the sources of all data and is continually updated, making it suitable for research and clinical applications that require up-to-date disease knowledge.Evidence before this study Many disease terminologies currently exist, but there is not a definitive standard for encoding diseases while addressing requirements for information exchange. Existing sources of disease definitions include the National Cancer Institute Thesaurus (NCIt), the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), Orphanet, SNOMED CT, Disease Ontology (DO), ICD-10, MedGen, and numerous others. Each of these is designed for a particular purpose, and as such has different strengths. However, these standards only partially overlap and often conflict in the classification or mapping approach, making it difficult to align them with each other and/or with other knowledge sources. This need to integrate information has resulted in a proliferation of mappings between disease entries in different resources; these mappings lack completeness, accuracy, and precision, and are often inconsistent between resources.Added value of this study In order to computationally leverage the available knowledge sources for diagnostics and to reveal underlying mechanisms of diseases, we need to understand which terms are meaningfully equivalent across different resources. This will allow integration of associated information, such as treatments, genetics, phenotypes, etc. We therefore created the Mondo Disease Ontology to provide a logic-based structure for unifying multiple disease resources.Implications of all the available evidence Mondo can be leveraged by researchers and clinicians for disease annotations and data integration to aid in clinical diagnosis, treatment and advancement of human health care. Mondo is a freely available, open terminology that contains over 20,000 disease classes. Mondo is iteratively developed with contributions from the intended community and is under continuous revision, with future plans to further revise the top-level classes. Recently, efforts to classify rare diseases have centered on retrieving terms from various sources to provide a unified resource. Mondo can be explored using any of a variety of ontology browsers such as the Ontology Lookup Service (OLS) (ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mondo), and the ontology files and current releases are available on GitHub (github.com/monarch-initiative/mondo).Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementMondo is generously supported by the NIH National Human Genome Research Institute Phenomics First Resource, NIH-NHGRI ⋕ 1 RM1 HG010860-01, a Center of Excellence in Genomic Science; and an NIH Office of the Director Grant ⋕5R24OD011883 for the Monarch Initiative.

Materials \& Methods A sample of 33 phenotype definitions used in research and published to the Phenotype KnowledgeBase (PheKB), that are represented using Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and Clinical Quality Language (CQL) was analyzed using automated analysis of the computable representation of the CQL libraries.
Results Most of the phenotype definitions include narrative descriptions and flowcharts, while few provide pseudocode or executable artifacts. Most use 4 or fewer medical terminologies. The number of codes used ranges from 5 to 6865, and value sets from 1 to 19. We found the most common expressions used were literal, data, and logical expressions. Aggregate and arithmetic expressions are the least common. Expression depth ranges from 4 to 27.
Discussion Despite the range of conditions, we found that all of the phenotype definitions consisted of logical criteria, representing both clinical and operational logic, and tabular data, consisting of codes from standard terminologies and keywords for natural language processing. The total number and variety of expressions is low, which may be to simplify implementation, or authors may limit complexity due to data availability constraints.
Conclusion The phenotypes analyzed show significant variation in specific logical, arithmetic and other operators, but are all composed of the same high-level components, namely tabular data and logical expressions. A standard representation for phenotype definitions should support these formats and be modular to support localization and shared logic.},

	doi = {10.5281/zenodo.6382431},
	abstract = {This scoping report represents a mission-oriented approach to supporting citizens' engagement and public trust in genomic data sharing, scoping out and suggesting possible approaches. It recognises from the outset that the issues of engagement and trust extend beyond the indispensable involvement of citizens to embrace a much wider range of stakeholders whose buy-in will also be essential to success. This review takes account of the B1MG and 1+MG, and aims to offer conceptual and practical steps for building on those achievements to bridge potential and actual benefits to science and society with a specific focus on citizens.   The rapid progress that has been made in genomics over the past two decades has created much debate (Boccia, 20141). On the one hand, genomics has the potential to deliver earlier diagnosis, more effective prevention programmes and more precise targeting of therapies, in some cases challenging our understanding of the nature of certain diseases. On the other hand, it raises a range of ethical, social and legal challenges (ELSI), including among other issues, protection and ownership of data, the need for care in interpreting data, potential misuse of data by commercial organisations, especially insurance companies, and questions about autonomy and the potential for stigma (National Research Council, 1988). As insights from genomics are increasingly used in clinical settings to inform personalised medicine, these ELSI considerations have been broadened, with many concerned this will widen existing inequalities in health care (Brothers \& Rothstein, 20152). While genetic testing may improve disease prediction, diagnosis, and treatment, the rapid uptake and application of genetics and genomics raise numerous ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSI). One of the most prominent among these is the growing number of possibilities of using genetic information to justify treating individuals differently or profiling specific population groups that may lead to genetic discrimination (GD) (Kim, 20213). The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is an important regulatory change at the EU level that has significant implications for the processing of genomic data in research and clinical practice. Recital 51 of the GDPR designates personal data which is, by its nature, particularly sensitive in relation to fundamental rights and freedoms as requiring specific protection, as the context of its processing could create significant risks to those fundamental rights and freedoms. Beside data generation and processing, ensuring data privacy and security requires robust infrastructure, training, as well as careful regulation of access. To capture the full benefits of genomic data, it must be shared with multiple actors, including: researchers to support academic and clinical research; health providers to support delivery of health services and public health activities; and commercial organisations involved in developing and implementing new health technologies or delivering health care services (Williams et al, 2021 4). Data sharing to facilitate greater genomic research and translation of findings into clinical use relies on the implementation of advanced technological solutions, health workers with the right skills and training to contribute to implementation, the active involvement of citizens and patients that support translation, and implementation of strong regulatory and governance procedures (Raza \& Hall, 20175). In this context, it is unavoidable to mention the concurrent COVID-19 pandemic, in view of the evolution of public awareness of science, as hopes have grown for vaccines and treatments to counter COVID-19. But this enhanced awareness carries corresponding responsibilities alongside the obvious potential benefits for mustering support for science. The pace of change, already increasingly rapid as science opens ever more doors to understanding of health, disease, diagnosis and treatment, has received dramatic new impetus through the exigencies of the COVID 19. Never in modern times has the population of the planet been subject to such a direct threat to health, and never have science and technology responded with such alacrity, energy and effectiveness. As the European Council secretariat explains in updating on progress towards an international agreement on pandemics, "the sharing of pathogens, biological samples and genomic data as well as the development of timely medical solutions (vaccines, treatments and diagnostics) are vital in order to enhance global pandemic preparedness." (https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/coronavirus/pandemic-treaty/) The corresponding leap in citizens' awareness and expectations of the world of science is however presenting a new dilemma: while health policy is encouraging and promoting (and indeed very largely depending on) science to solve the unprecedented challenge that COVID 19 presents, it also has to cater to the importance of bringing society along with developments, to foster understanding and to counter scepticism, suspicion, doubt and even hostility. This concern informs the European Parliament resolution on strengthening the fight against cancer, adopted by the plenary on 16 February 2022. It "encourages the Commission and the Member States to promote the knowledge of cancer biology through the implementation of genomics and informatics infrastructures; urges all implementation partners to be ever mindful of the principles of data privacy and security, trust, transparency, patient centricity and patient involvement at all times." (https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2022-0038\_EN.html) Against this background, it is prudent to consider the risk that the application of genome technology to healthcare, despite all its multiple potential benefits as a breakthrough in healthcare, could be confronted with similar turbulence and even negative opinion unless meticulous attention is paid to the challenges of gaining public understanding. Public understanding is vital in itself to gain trust on this data acquisition – but it is also an indispensable condition for obtaining the policy support that genomic medicine demands for implementing this ambitious project. At the heart of the 1+MG/B1MG concept is the collection and exchange of citizens' data. It is consequently implicit in the logic of the exercise that the interests of the citizens – whose data is to be collected and exchanged – should receive priority attention, even while solutions are found to the myriad technical, scientific, legal and political issues that the project also raises. This paper brings focus to this dilemma in European terms, scoping out both the potential and the challenges, and suggesting some approaches that can improve the chances of successful conciliation and mutual understanding between science and citizens – with the attendant benefits accruing to society as a whole.},

	abstract = {BackgroundAn essential step in any medical research project after identifying the research question is to determine if there are sufficient patients available for a study and where to find them. Pursuing digital feasibility queries on available patient data registries has proven to be an excellent way of reusing existing real-world data sources. To support multicentric research, these feasibility queries should be designed and implemented to run across multiple sites and securely access local data. Working across hospitals usually involves working with different data formats and vocabularies. Recently, the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard was developed by Health Level Seven to address this concern and describe patient data in a standardized format. The Medical Informatics Initiative in Germany has committed to this standard and created data integration centers, which convert existing data into the FHIR format at each hospital. This partially solves the interoperability problem; however, a distributed feasibility query platform for the FHIR standard is still missing.ObjectiveThis study described the design and implementation of the components involved in creating a cross-hospital feasibility query platform for researchers based on FHIR resources. This effort was part of a large COVID-19 data exchange platform and was designed to be scalable for a broad range of patient data.MethodsWe analyzed and designed the abstract components necessary for a distributed feasibility query. This included a user interface for creating the query, backend with an ontology and terminology service, middleware for query distribution, and FHIR feasibility query execution service.ResultsWe implemented the components described in the Methods section. The resulting solution was distributed to 33 German university hospitals. The functionality of the comprehensive network infrastructure was demonstrated using a test data set based on the German Corona Consensus Data Set. A performance test using specifically created synthetic data revealed the applicability of our solution to data sets containing millions of FHIR resources. The solution can be easily deployed across hospitals and supports feasibility queries, combining multiple inclusion and exclusion criteria using standard Health Level Seven query languages such as Clinical Quality Language and FHIR Search. Developing a platform based on multiple microservices allowed us to create an extendable platform and support multiple Health Level Seven query languages and middleware components to allow integration with future directions of the Medical Informatics Initiative.ConclusionsWe designed and implemented a feasibility platform for distributed feasibility queries, which works directly on FHIR-formatted data and distributed it across 33 university hospitals in Germany. We showed that developing a feasibility platform directly on the FHIR standard is feasible.},

	abstract = {ObjectivesThe HL7® fast healthcare interoperability resources (FHIR®) specification has emerged as the leading interoperability standard for the exchange of healthcare data. We conducted a scoping review to identify trends and gaps in the use of FHIR for clinical research.Materials and methodsWe reviewed published literature, federally funded project databases, application websites, and other sources to discover FHIR-based papers, projects, and tools (collectively, "FHIR projects") available to support clinical research activities.ResultsOur search identified 203 different FHIR projects applicable to clinical research. Most were associated with preparations to conduct research, such as data mapping to and from FHIR formats (n = 66, 32.5\%) and managing ontologies with FHIR (n = 30, 14.8\%), or post-study data activities, such as sharing data using repositories or registries (n = 24, 11.8\%), general research data sharing (n = 23, 11.3\%), and management of genomic data (n = 21, 10.3\%). With the exception of phenotyping (n = 19, 9.4\%), fewer FHIR-based projects focused on needs within the clinical research process itself.DiscussionFunding and usage of FHIR-enabled solutions for research are expanding, but most projects appear focused on establishing data pipelines and linking clinical systems such as electronic health records, patient-facing data systems, and registries, possibly due to the relative newness of FHIR and the incentives for FHIR integration in health information systems. Fewer FHIR projects were associated with research-only activities.ConclusionThe FHIR standard is becoming an essential component of the clinical research enterprise. To develop FHIR's full potential for clinical research, funding and operational stakeholders should address gaps in FHIR-based research tools and methods.},

Experimental data have been generated on a huge number of organisms, tissue types, treatment conditions and disease states. The Gene Expression Omnibus ( Barrett et al., 2005), developed by the National Center for Bioinformatics (NCBI) at the National Institutes of Health is a repository of nearly 140 000 gene expression experiments. The BioConductor project (Gentleman et al., 2004) is an open-source and open-development software project built in the R statistical programming environment (R Development core Team, 2005) for the analysis and comprehension of genomic data. The tools contained in the BioConductor project represent many state-of-the-art methods for the analysis of microarray and genomics data. We have developed a software tool that allows access to the wealth of information within GEO directly from BioConductor, eliminating many the formatting and parsing problems that have made such analyses labor-intensive in the past. The software, called GEOquery, effectively establishes a bridge between GEO and BioConductor. Easy access to GEO data from BioConductor will likely lead to new analyses of GEO data using novel and rigorous statistical and bioinformatic tools. Facilitating analyses and metaanalyses of microarray data will increase the efficiency with which biologically important conclusions can be drawn from published genomic data.},

Navigating the vast sea of tools now available is becoming increasingly challenging for researchers. In order to better facilitate selection of appropriate analysis tools we have created the scRNA-tools database (www.scRNA-tools.org) to catalogue and curate analysis tools as they become available. Our database collects a range of information on each scRNA-seq analysis tool and categorises them according to the analysis tasks they perform. Exploration of this database gives insights into the areas of rapid development of analysis methods for scRNA-seq data. We see that many tools perform tasks specific to scRNA-seq analysis, particularly clustering and ordering of cells. We also find that the scRNA-seq community embraces an open-source and open-science approach, with most tools available under open-source licenses and preprints being extensively used as a means to describe methods. The scRNA-tools database provides a valuable resource for researchers embarking on scRNA-seq analysis and records the growth of the field over time.},

The existing literature shows different methods to overcome this problem. Fast healthcare interoperable resources (FHIR) as a structural standard may explain other information models, (e.g., personal, physiological, and behavioral data from heterogeneous sources, such as activity sensors, questionnaires, and interviews) with semantic vocabularies, (e.g., Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine—Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT)) to connect personal health data to an electronic health record (EHR). We design and develop an intuitive health coaching (eCoach) smartphone application to prove the concept. We combine HL7 FHIR and SNOMED-CT vocabularies to exchange personal health data in JavaScript object notion (JSON). This study explores and analyzes our attempt to design and implement a structurally and logically compatible tethered personal health record (PHR) that allows bidirectional communication with an EHR. Our eCoach prototype implements most PHR-S FM functions as an interoperability quality standard. Its end-to-end (E2E) data are protected with a TSD (Services for Sensitive Data) security mechanism. We achieve 0\% data loss and 0\% unreliable performances during data transfer between PHR and EHR. Furthermore, this experimental study shows the effectiveness of FHIR modular resources toward flexible management of data components in the PHR (eCoach) prototype.},

	abstract = {Background: The standard Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is widely used in health information technology. However, its use as a standard for health research is still less prevalent. To use existing data sources more efficiently for health research, data interoperability becomes increasingly important. FHIR provides solutions by offering resource domains such as “Public Health \&amp; Research” and “Evidence-Based Medicine” while using already established web technologies. Therefore, FHIR could help standardize data across different data sources and improve interoperability in health research.
Objective: The aim of our study was to provide a systematic review of existing literature and determine the current state of FHIR implementations in health research and possible future directions.
Methods: We searched the PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and Cochrane Library databases for studies published from 2011 to 2022. Studies investigating the use of FHIR in health research were included. Articles published before 2011, abstracts, reviews, editorials, and expert opinions were excluded. We followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and registered this study with PROSPERO (CRD42021235393). Data synthesis was done in tables and figures.
Results: We identified a total of 998 studies, of which 49 studies were eligible for inclusion. Of the 49 studies, most (73\%, n=36) covered the domain of clinical research, whereas the remaining studies focused on public health or epidemiology (6\%, n=3) or did not specify their research domain (20\%, n=10). Studies used FHIR for data capture (29\%, n=14), standardization of data (41\%, n=20), analysis (12\%, n=6), recruitment (14\%, n=7), and consent management (4\%, n=2). Most (55\%, 27/49) of the studies had a generic approach, and 55\% (12/22) of the studies focusing on specific medical specialties (infectious disease, genomics, oncology, environmental health, imaging, and pulmonary hypertension) reported their solutions to be conferrable to other use cases. Most (63\%, 31/49) of the studies reported using additional data models or terminologies: Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (29\%, n=14), Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (37\%, n=18), International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (18\%, n=9), Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model (12\%, n=6), and others (43\%, n=21). Only 4 (8\%) studies used a FHIR resource from the domain “Public Health \&amp; Research.” Limitations using FHIR included the possible change in the content of FHIR resources, safety, legal matters, and the need for a FHIR server.
Conclusions: Our review found that FHIR can be implemented in health research, and the areas of application are broad and generalizable in most use cases. The implementation of international terminologies was common, and other standards such as the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model could be used as a complement to FHIR. Limitations such as the change of FHIR content, lack of FHIR implementation, safety, and legal matters need to be addressed in future releases to expand the use of FHIR and, therefore, interoperability in health research.},

Thus, care must be taken when they are processed and made available to comply with ethical and regulatory frameworks and informed consent data conditions. To enable and streamline data access for these biomedical datasets, the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) Data Use and Researcher Identities (DURI) work stream developed and approved the Data Use Ontology (DUO) standard. DUO is a hierarchical vocabulary of human and machine-readable data use terms that consistently and unambiguously represents a dataset’s allowable data uses. DUO has been implemented by major international stakeholders such as the Broad and Sanger Institutes and is currently used in annotation of over 200,000 datasets worldwide. Using DUO in data management and access facilitates researchers’ discovery and access of relevant datasets. DUO annotations increase the FAIRness of datasets and support data linkages using common data use profiles when integrating the data for secondary analyses. DUO is implemented in the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and, to increase community awareness and engagement, hosted in an open, centralized GitHub repository. DUO, together with the GA4GH Passport standard, offers a new, efficient, and streamlined data authorization and access framework that has enabled increased sharing of biomedical datasets worldwide.},

Visas are issued by data stewards, including data access committees (DACs) working with public databases, the entities responsible for the quality, integrity, and access arrangements for the datasets in the management of human biomedical data. Passports streamline management of data access rights across data systems by using visas that present a data user’s digital identity and permissions across organizations, tools, environments, and services.

The number of experiments based on sequencing technologies, in particular RNA-seq experiments, has been increasing over the last few years and submissions of sequencing data have overtaken microarray experiments in the last 12 months. Additionally, there is a significant increase in experiments investigating single cells, rather than bulk samples, known as single-cell RNA-seq. To accommodate these trends, we have substantially changed our submission tool Annotare which, along with raw and processed data, collects all metadata necessary to interpret these experiments. Selected datasets are re-processed and loaded into our sister resource, the value-added Expression Atlas (and its component Single Cell Expression Atlas), which not only enables users to interpret the data easily but also serves as a test for data quality. With an increasing number of studies that combine different assay modalities (multi-omics experiments), a new more general archival resource the BioStudies Database has been developed, which will eventually supersede ArrayExpress. Data submissions will continue unchanged; all existing ArrayExpress data will be incorporated into BioStudies and the existing accession numbers and application programming interfaces will be maintained.},

The DC model enables individuals to know and to decide how personal research information is being used and provides a way in which to exercise legal rights provided in privacy and data protection law. The DC tool is flexible and responsive, enabling legal and ethical requirements in research data sharing to be met and for online health information to be maintained. DC has been used in rare diseases and genomics, to enable people to control and express their preferences regarding their own data. However, DC has never been explored in relationship to historical collections of bioscientific and genetic heritage or to contexts involving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people (First Peoples of Australia).In response to the growing interest by First Peoples throughout Australia in genetic and genomic research, and the increasing number of invitations from researchers to participate in community health and wellbeing projects, this article examines the legal and ethical attributes and challenges of DC in these contexts. It also explores opportunities for including First Peoples' cultural perspectives, governance, and leadership as a method for defining (or redefining) DC on cultural terms that engage best practice research and data analysis as well as respect for meaningful and longitudinal individual and family participation.},

	title = {Genomic {Data} in {Australia}: {An} industry perspective on clarity, certainty and standardisation},
	abstract = {The collection, management and exchange of genomic data into healthcare delivery is critical to supporting better
person-centred care, driving value to the health system and to building a thriving research ecosystem. The delivery
of mature genomics information management which supports the integration of genomics into mainstream health
care requires a comprehensive and collaborative approach.
The genomics industry has an important role in delivering this maturity and ensuring that value is derived for all
stakeholders. With the establishment of the Industry Genomics Network Alliance (InGeNA) in 2020, it is now
appropriate to examine industry’s role in leveraging the value of genomic data to support better health outcomes
for Australians.
Engagement with stakeholders from industry, healthcare, research and consumers indicated three consistent
themes, being a need for clarity in how the sector communicates, certainty about regulatory and compliance
matters, and the importance of standards adoption to support the application of genomics to realise the value for
people, the healthcare sector and the research community.
As a united voice for the genomics industry, InGeNA has undertaken a review of the Australian genomic data
landscape to identify the challenges and opportunities evidence regarding the management, governance, sharing
and use of genomic data to support better outcomes for all Australians. This report then considers the role that
InGeNA can play in supporting the delivery of this potential.
By establishing shared positions regarding how genomic data is shared, managed and used in Australia, InGeNA
can engage with governments at all levels, and with professional bodies, consumer groups, research groups and
the broader healthcare sector to support and encourage the appropriate use of genomic data in Australia without
the perception of self-interest that any one organisation may attract. Indeed, the very diversity of interests among
the InGeNA membership ensures that a balanced and positive position can be found across a range of topics.
This report is intended primarily as an input to planning for InGeNA. However, it should also serve as a useful
guide to the value industry can bring to public health, research and the broader sector.},

	abstract = {A group of publishers came together to discuss how we could reduce the complexity and inconsistency provided in publisher's advice to researchers when selecting an appropriate data repository. It is a shared goal among publishers and other stakeholders to increase repository use – which remains far from optimal – and we assume that helping researchers find a suitable repository more easily will help achieve this. To address this a list of features has been created and it is intended only as a framework within which publishers can make recommendations to researchers, not as a way to restrict which repositories researchers may choose for their data. Our intention is that the features we highlight will act to initiate engagement and collaboration among publishers, repositories and the RPOs, government and funders that ultimately make the policies around Open Research. As we start this conversation, it is important that we act together with other stakeholders to raise awareness of the challenges involved around FAIR data and to prevent any perverse consequences. From the RDA FAIRsharing WG point of view, the ultimate objective is to map repository features across all existing initiatives, and to identify a common core set of metadata fields that all stakeholders want to see in registry of repositories. The FAIRsharing registry in particular is agnostic as to the selection process of standards, repositories and policies, as part of its commitment to working with and for all stakeholder groups.},

	abstract = {The Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) aims to accelerate biomedical advances by enabling the responsible sharing of clinical and genomic data through both harmonized data aggregation and federated approaches. The decreasing cost of genomic sequencing (along with other genome-wide molecular assays) and increasing evidence of its clinical utility will soon drive the generation of sequence data from tens of millions of humans, with increasing levels of diversity. In this perspective, we present the GA4GH strategies for addressing the major challenges of this data revolution. We describe the GA4GH organization, which is fueled by the development efforts of eight Work Streams and informed by the needs of 24 Driver Projects and other key stakeholders. We present the GA4GH suite of secure, interoperable technical standards and policy frameworks and review the current status of standards, their relevance to key domains of research and clinical care, and future plans of GA4GH. Broad international participation in building, adopting, and deploying GA4GH standards and frameworks will catalyze an unprecedented effort in data sharing that will be critical to advancing genomic medicine and ensuring that all populations can access its benefits.},

A detailed example is presented that illustrates how to use the schema to represent the clinical course of a patient with retinoblastoma, including demographic information, the clinical diagnosis, phenotypic features and clinical measurements, an examination of the extirpated tumor, therapies, and the results of genomic analysis. The Phenopacket Schema, together with other GA4GH data and technical standards, will enable data exchange and provide a foundation for the computational analysis of disease and phenotype information to improve our ability to diagnose and conduct research on all types of disorders, including cancer and rare diseases.},

The Global Forum on Bioethics in Research (GFBR) convened in Stellenbosch, South Africa in November 2018, to explore the ethics of data sharing and biobanking in health research. Ninety-five participants from 35 countries drew on case studies and their experiences with sharing in their discussion of issues relating to respecting research participants and communities, promoting equitable sharing, and international and national approaches to governing data sharing and biobanking.

Beyond privacy laws, which only apply to genomic data that meets the definition of personal information, the key regulatory lever is the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) National Statement for Ethical Conduct in Human Research ("National Statement") (2007). Compliance with the National Statement is a requirement for institutions to apply to the NHMRC for funding, and includes-among other things-requirements for review of most genomic research by Human Research Ethics Committees. The sections of the National Statement specifying requirements for research with human genomic data are currently under review, including proposed new requirements addressing the return of genetic research findings and oversight of transfer agreements. Ensuring the willingness of Australians to donate their genomic information and participate in medical research will require clarification and harmonisation of the applicable regulatory framework, along with reforms to ensure that these regulations reflect the conditions necessary to promote ongoing public trust in researchers and institutions.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12874-016-0169-4},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Greater transparency and, in particular, sharing of patient-level data for further scientific research is an increasingly important topic for the pharmaceutical industry and other organisations who sponsor and conduct clinical trials as well as generally in the interests of patients participating in studies. A concern remains, however, over how to appropriately prepare and share clinical trial data with third party researchers, whilst maintaining patient confidentiality. Clinical trial datasets contain very detailed information on each participant. Risk to patient privacy can be mitigated by data reduction techniques. However, retention of data utility is important in order to allow meaningful scientific research. In addition, for clinical trial data, an excessive application of such techniques may pose a public health risk if misleading results are produced. After considering existing guidance, this article makes recommendations with the aim of promoting an approach that balances data utility and privacy risk and is applicable across clinical trial data holders. DISCUSSION: Our key recommendations are as follows: 1. Data anonymisation/de-identification: Data holders are responsible for generating de-identified datasets which are intended to offer increased protection for patient privacy through masking or generalisation of direct and some indirect identifiers. 2. Controlled access to data, including use of a data sharing agreement: A legally binding data sharing agreement should be in place, including agreements not to download or further share data and not to attempt to seek to identify patients. Appropriate levels of security should be used for transferring data or providing access; one solution is use of a secure 'locked box' system which provides additional safeguards. This article provides recommendations on best practices to de-identify/anonymise clinical trial data for sharing with third-party researchers, as well as controlled access to data and data sharing agreements. The recommendations are applicable to all clinical trial data holders. Further work will be needed to identify and evaluate competing possibilities as regulations, attitudes to risk and technologies evolve.},

At the same time, citizens have different expectations and fears about that data sharing. International legislation in relation with research ethics and practice and, particularly, data protection create a particular environment that, as is seen in the articles in part two of this special issue, are crying out for harmonisation both at a procedural but at fundamental conceptual levels. The law of data sharing is pulling in different directions. This paper poses the question, 'harmonisation, an impossible dream?' and the answer is a qualified 'no'. The paper reflects on what can be seen in the papers in part two of the special issue. It then identifies three major areas of conceptual uncertainty in the new EU General Data Protection Regulation (not because it has superiority over other jurisdictions, but because it is a recent revision of data protection law that leaves universal conceptual questions unclear). Thereafter, the potential for Artificial Intelligence to meet some of the shortcomings is discussed. The paper ends with a consideration of the conditions under which data sharing harmonisation might be achieved: an understanding of a human rights approach and citizen sensitivities in considering the 'public interest'; social liberalism as a basis of solidarity; and the profession of 'researcher'.},

We evaluated data availability in research articles across nine disciplines in Nature and Science magazines and recorded corresponding authors' concerns, requests and reasons for declining data sharing. Although data sharing has improved in the last decade and particularly in recent years, data availability and willingness to share data still differ greatly among disciplines. We observed that statements of data availability upon (reasonable) request are inefficient and should not be allowed by journals. To improve data sharing at the time of manuscript acceptance, researchers should be better motivated to release their data with real benefits such as recognition, or bonus points in grant and job applications. We recommend that data management costs should be covered by funding agencies; publicly available research data ought to be included in the evaluation of applications; and surveillance of data sharing should be enforced by both academic publishers and funders.

	abstract = {An increasing amount of attention has been geared towards understanding the privacy risks that arise from sharing genomic data of human origin. Most of these efforts have focused on issues in the context of genomic sequence data, but the popularity of techniques for collecting other types of genome-related data has prompted researchers to investigate privacy concerns in a broader genomic context. In this review, we give an overview of different types of genome-associated data, their individual ways of revealing sensitive information, the motivation to share them as well as established and upcoming methods to minimize information leakage. We further discuss the concise threats that are being posed, who is at risk, and how the risk level compares to potential benefits, all while addressing the topic in the context of modern technology, methodology, and information sharing culture. Additionally, we will discuss the current legal situation regarding the sharing of genomic data in a selection of countries, evaluating the scope of their applicability as well as their limitations. We will finalize this review by evaluating the development that is required in the scientific field in the near future in order to improve and develop privacy-preserving data sharing techniques for the genomic context.

	abstract = {Canada's regulatory frameworks governing privacy and research are generally permissive of genomic data sharing, though they may soon be tightened in response to public concerns over commercial data handling practices and the strengthening of influential European privacy laws. Regulation can seem complex and uncertain, in part because of the constitutional division of power between federal and provincial governments over both privacy and health care. Broad consent is commonly practiced in genomic research, but without explicit regulatory recognition, it is often scrutinized by research or privacy oversight bodies. Secondary use of health-care data is legally permissible under limited circumstances. A new federal law prohibits genetic discrimination, but is subject to a constitutional challenge. Privacy laws require security safeguards proportionate to the data sensitivity, including breach notification. Special categories of data are not defined a priori. With some exceptions, Canadian researchers are permitted to share personal information internationally but are held accountable for safeguarding the privacy and security of these data. Cloud computing to store and share large scale data sets is permitted, if shared responsibilities for access, responsible use, and security are carefully articulated. For the moment, Canada's commercial sector is recognized as "adequate" by Europe, facilitating import of European data. Maintaining adequacy status under the new European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a concern because of Canada's weaker individual rights, privacy protections, and regulatory enforcement. Researchers must stay attuned to shifting international and national regulations to ensure a sustainable future for responsible genomic data sharing.},

	abstract = {The evolution of genomic research and its integration into clinical practice, as they become international-even global-endeavors, has brought us to a place where scientists and clinicians may now only ignore the rules governing international data sharing at their own peril. Open data policies, on the one hand, increasingly require custodians of others' genomic data to make it as widely available as feasible, including to researchers in other countries. Data protection law, on the other, has become a significant hurdle to the sharing of personal data across jurisdictional borders. The space between these two competing duties is narrowing. In contrast with the other texts in this volume, which explore the present and future of data sharing and data protection, this article's focus is on the past. It centres on the historical development of the data protection rules regarding the international transfer of personal data up to the present. The article's aim is to bring into focus the underlying objectives that have influenced and that will continue to influence the way that data protection rules are applied to the fields of genomics and health, as well as future developments in data protection generally. The first part of this article describes the development of international data-sharing data protection rules since 1970. The second considers difficulties in applying general data protection rules to the specific context of genomics and health. The third and final part compares the options available to comply with the international transfer restrictions set out in the standard-setting EU General Data Protection Regulation from a genomics perspective.},

Juni 2017, BGBl. 2017 I p. 2097 et seq.). Despite being directly binding on all EU member states, the GDPR does not render national data protection provision obsolete-they are covered by the GDPR's opening clauses which include regulatory mandates and room for derogation. This creates considerable need for national legislative adaptation. Art. 1 DSAnpUG-EU contains the necessary amendments to the Federal Data Protection Law (BDSG(neu)), thus creating the second major building block of future German data protection alongside the GDPR itself. Nevertheless, there are still numerous sector-specific regulations in other federal laws and the data protection laws of the 16 states also need amendments. Adjustment in Germany is well on its way, but implementation in general is still ongoing, with further consequences for data processing and sharing.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Large-scale linkage of international clinical datasets could lead to unique insights into disease aetiology and facilitate treatment evaluation and drug development. Hereto, multi-stakeholder consortia are currently designing several disease-specific translational research platforms to enable international health data sharing. Despite the recent adoption of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the procedures for how to govern responsible data sharing in such projects are not at all spelled out yet. In search of a first, basic outline of an ethical governance framework, we set out to explore relevant ethical principles and norms. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of literature and ethical guidelines for principles and norms pertaining to data sharing for international health research. RESULTS: We observed an abundance of principles and norms with considerable convergence at the aggregate level of four overarching themes: societal benefits and value; distribution of risks, benefits and burdens; respect for individuals and groups; and public trust and engagement. However, at the level of principles and norms we identified substantial variation in the phrasing and level of detail, the number and content of norms considered necessary to protect a principle, and the contextual approaches in which principles and norms are used. CONCLUSIONS: While providing some helpful leads for further work on a coherent governance framework for data sharing, the current collection of principles and norms prompts important questions about how to streamline terminology regarding de-identification and how to harmonise the identified principles and norms into a coherent governance framework that promotes data sharing while securing public trust.},

The number of submitted datasets to PRIDE Archive (the archival component of PRIDE) has reached on average around 500 datasets per month during 2021. In addition to continuous improvements in PRIDE Archive data pipelines and infrastructure, the PRIDE Spectra Archive has been developed to provide direct access to the submitted mass spectra using Universal Spectrum Identifiers. As a key point, the file format MAGE-TAB for proteomics has been developed to enable the improvement of sample metadata annotation. Additionally, the resource PRIDE Peptidome provides access to aggregated peptide/protein evidences across PRIDE Archive. Furthermore, we will describe how PRIDE has increased its efforts to reuse and disseminate high-quality proteomics data into other added-value resources such as UniProt, Ensembl and Expression Atlas.},

Fast, reciprocal data exchange was fully established between sister Biosample databases and other INSDC partners, enabling a worldwide common representation and centralization of sample metadata. The BioSamples platform has been upgraded to accommodate anticipated increases in the number of submissions via GA4GH driver projects such as the Human Cell Atlas and the EGA, as well as from mirroring of NCBI dbGaP data. The BioSamples database is now the authoritative repository for all INSDC sample metadata, an ELIXIR Deposition Database for Biomolecular Data and the EMBL-EBI sample metadata hub. To support faster turnaround for sample submission, and to increase scalability and resilience, we have upgraded the BioSamples database backend storage, APIs and user interface. Finally, the website has been redesigned to allow search and retrieval of records based on specific filters, such as ‘disease’ or ‘organism’. These changes are targeted at answering current use cases as well as providing functionalities for future emerging and anticipated developments.

Single-cell transcriptomics [single-cell RNA sequencing (SC-RNA-seq)] has an immense potential of uncovering the novel basis of human life. The well-known heterogeneity of cells at the individual level can be better studied by single-cell transcriptomics. Proper downstream analysis of this data will provide new insights into the scientific communities. However, due to low starting materials, the SC-RNA-seq data face various computational challenges: normalization, differential gene expression analysis, dimensionality reduction, etc. Additionally, new methods like 10× Chromium can profile millions of cells in parallel, which creates a considerable amount of data. Thus, single-cell data handling is another big challenge. This paper reviews the single-cell sequencing methods, library preparation, and data generation.

We examine the advice by regulators not to rely upon consent as a lawful basis for processing under data protection law, at least not when personal data are used for research purposes, and consider some of the other ways in which the research context can qualify an individual's ability to exercise control over processing operations. We explain how the process of pseudonymization is to be understood in the context of transfer of genomic data to third parties, as well as how adequacy of data protection in a third country is to be determined in general terms.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Biobanks provide an important foundation for genomic and personalised medicine. In order to enhance their scientific power and scope, they are increasingly becoming part of national or international networks. Public trust is essential in fostering public engagement, encouraging donation to, and facilitating public funding for biobanks. Globalisation and networking of biobanking may challenge this trust. METHODS: We report the results of an Australian study examining public attitudes to the networking and globalisation of biobanks. The study used quantitative and qualitative methods in conjunction with bioethical analysis in order to determine factors that may contribute to, and threaten, trust. RESULTS: Our results indicate a generally high level of trust in biobanks and in medical research more broadly. Key factors that can reduce perceived trustworthiness of biobanks are commercialisation and involvement in global networking. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that robust ethical oversight and governance standards can both promote trust in global biobanking and ensure that this trust is warranted.},

The AnVIL is a federated cloud platform designed to manage and store genomics and related data, enable population-scale analysis, and facilitate collaboration through the sharing of data, code, and analysis results. By inverting the traditional model of data sharing, the AnVIL eliminates the need for data movement while also adding security measures for active threat detection and monitoring and provides scalable, shared computing resources for any researcher. We describe the core data management and analysis components of the AnVIL, which currently consists of Terra, Gen3, Galaxy, RStudio/Bioconductor, Dockstore, and Jupyter, and describe several flagship genomics datasets available within the AnVIL. We continue to extend and innovate the AnVIL ecosystem by implementing new capabilities, including mechanisms for interoperability and responsible data sharing, while streamlining access management. The AnVIL opens many new opportunities for analysis, collaboration, and data sharing that are needed to drive research and to make discoveries through the joint analysis of hundreds of thousands to millions of genomes along with associated clinical and molecular data types.},

	abstract = {In recent decades, the scientific community has become aware of the importance of science being effectively open in order to speed up scientific and technological progress. In this context, the achievement of a robust, effective and responsible form of data sharing is now widely acknowledged as a fundamental part of the research process. The production and resolution of human genomic data has steadily increased in recent years, mainly due to technological advances and decreasing costs of DNA genotyping and sequencing. There is, however, a downside to this process due to the huge increase in the complexity of the data and related metadata. This means it is advisable to go beyond traditional forms of sharing analysis, which have focused on data availability only. Here we present a pilot study that aims to complement a survey on the availability of data related to peer-reviewed publications with an analysis of their findability, accessibility, useability and assessability (according to the "intelligent data openness" scheme). Sharing rates in genomic anthropology (73.0\%) were found to be higher than human genomics (32.4\%), but lower than closely related research fields (from 96.8\% to 79.2\% for paleogenetics and evolutionary genetics, respectively). We discuss the privacy and methodological issues that could be linked to this finding. Comparisons of sharing rates across a wide range of disciplines has suggested that the idea of human genomics as a forerunner for the open data movement should be questioned. Finally, both in genomic anthropology and human genomics, findability and useability were found to be compliant with the expectations of an intelligent data openness, whereas only a minor part of studies met the need to make the data completely assessable.},

GSA-Human, as a new partner of GSA, is a data repository specialized in human genetics-related data with controlled access and security. OMIX, as a critical complement to the two resources mentioned above, is an open archive for miscellaneous data.

	doi = {10.1200/CCI.20.00059},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Because of expanding interoperability requirements, structured patient data are increasingly available in electronic health records. Many oncology data elements (eg, staging, biomarkers, documentation of adverse events and cancer outcomes) remain challenging. The Minimal Common Oncology Data Elements (mCODE) project is a consensus data standard created to facilitate transmission of data of patients with cancer. METHODS: In 2018, mCODE was developed through a work group convened by ASCO, including oncologists, informaticians, researchers, and experts in terminologies and standards. The mCODE specification is organized by 6 high-level domains: patient, laboratory/vital, disease, genomics, treatment, and outcome. In total, 23 mCODE profiles are composed of 90 data elements. RESULTS: A conceptual model was published for public comment in January 2019 and, after additional refinement, the first public version of the mCODE (version 0.9.1) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) implementation guide (IG) was presented at the ASCO Annual Meeting in June 2019. The specification was approved for balloting by Health Level 7 International (HL7) in August 2019. mCODE passed the HL7 ballot in September 2019 with 86.5\% approval. The mCODE IG authors worked with HL7 reviewers to resolve all negative comments, leading to a modest expansion in the number of data elements and tighter alignment with FHIR and other HL7 conventions. The mCODE version 1.0 FHIR IG Standard for Trial Use was formally published on March 18, 2020. CONCLUSION: The mCODE project has the potential to offer tremendous benefits to cancer care delivery and research by creating an infrastructure to better share patient data. mCODE is available free from www.mCODEinitiative.org. Pilot implementations are underway, and a robust community of stakeholders has been assembled across the oncology ecosystem.},

Launched in 2008, the EGA has grown quickly, currently archiving over 4,500 studies from nearly one thousand institutions. The EGA operates a distributed data access model in which requests are made to the data controller, not to the EGA, therefore, the submitter keeps control on who has access to the data and under which conditions. Given the size and value of data hosted, the EGA is constantly improving its value chain, that is, how the EGA can contribute to enhancing the value of human health data by facilitating its submission, discovery, access, and distribution, as well as leading the design and implementation of standards and methods necessary to deliver the value chain. The EGA has become a key GA4GH Driver Project, leading multiple development efforts and implementing new standards and tools, and has been appointed as an ELIXIR Core Data Resource. © The Author(s) 2021.

	abstract = {Given the data-rich nature of modern biomedical research, there is a pressing need for a systematic, structured, computer-readable way to capture, communicate, and manage sharing rules that apply to biomedical resources. This is essential for responsible recording, versioning, communication, querying, and actioning of resource sharing plans. However, lack of a common "information model" for rules and conditions that govern the sharing of materials, methods, software, data, and knowledge creates a fundamental barrier. Without this, it can be virtually impossible for Research Ethics Committees (RECs), Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), Data Access Committees (DACs), biobanks, and end users to confidently track, manage, and interpret applicable legal and ethical requirements. This raises costs and burdens of data stewardship and decreases efficient and responsible access to data, biospecimens, and other resources. To address this, the GA4GH and IRDiRC organizations sponsored the creation of the Automatable Discovery and Access Matrix (ADA-M, read simply as "Adam"). ADA-M is a comprehensive information model that provides the basis for producing structured metadata "Profiles" of regulatory conditions, thereby enabling efficient application of those conditions across regulatory spheres. Widespread use of ADA-M will aid researchers in globally searching and prescreening potential data and/or biospecimen resources for compatibility with their research plans in a responsible and efficient manner, increasing likelihood of timely DAC approvals while also significantly reducing time and effort DACs, RECs, and IRBs spend evaluating resource requests and research proposals. Extensive online documentation, software support, video guides, and an Application Programming Interface (API) for ADA-M have been made available.},

	abstract = {Relatively little attention has been focused on standardization of data exchange in clinical research studies and patient care activities. Both are usually managed locally using separate and generally incompatible data systems at individual hospitals or clinics. In the past decade there have been nascent efforts to create data standards for clinical research and patient care data, and to some extent these are helpful in providing a degree of uniformity. Nonetheless, these data standards generally have not been converted into accepted computer-based language structures that could permit reliable data exchange across computer networks. The National Cardiovascular Research Infrastructure (NCRI) project was initiated with a major objective of creating a model framework for standard data exchange in all clinical research, clinical registry, and patient care environments, including all electronic health records. The goal is complete syntactic and semantic interoperability. A Data Standards Workgroup was established to create or identify and then harmonize clinical definitions for a base set of standardized cardiovascular data elements that could be used in this network infrastructure. Recognizing the need for continuity with prior efforts, the Workgroup examined existing data standards sources. A basic set of 353 elements was selected. The NCRI staff then collaborated with the 2 major technical standards organizations in health care, the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium and Health Level Seven International, as well as with staff from the National Cancer Institute Enterprise Vocabulary Services. Modeling and mapping were performed to represent (instantiate) the data elements in appropriate technical computer language structures for endorsement as an accepted data standard for public access and use. Fully implemented, these elements will facilitate clinical research, registry reporting, administrative reporting and regulatory compliance, and patient care.

METHODS: The Australian Diabetes Obesity and Lifestyle (AusDiab) Study is a national, population-based, longitudinal study of adults aged 25 years and above. A total sample of 4,405 people provided complete baseline (1999-2000) and 5 year follow-up (2004-2005) data relevant for these analyses. Fasting plasma glucose and 2 h plasma glucose were obtained from an OGTT, and demographic, socioeconomic and behavioural data were collected by interview and questionnaire. Multinomial logistic regression examined the role of socioeconomic position in the development of diabetes and mediation analyses tested the contribution of health behaviours in this relationship. RESULTS: Highest level of education was a stronger predictor of incident impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes (p = 0.002), compared with household income (p = 0.103), and occupational grade (p = 0.202). Education remained a significant independent predictor of diabetes in fully adjusted models. However, the relationship was attenuated by the health behaviours (smoking and physical activity). Mediation analyses indicated that these behaviours were partial mediators (explaining 27\%) of the socioeconomic status-diabetes relationship. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Smoking and physical activity partly mediate the relationship between low education and type 2 diabetes. Identification of these modifiable behavioural mediators should facilitate the development of effective health promotion campaigns to target those at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes.},

	abstract = {Rapid expansions of bioinformatics and computational biology have broadened the collection and use of -omics data including genomic, transcriptomic, methylomic and a myriad of other health data types, in the clinic and the laboratory. Both clinical and research uses of such data require co-analysis with large datasets, for which participant privacy and the need for data custodian controls must remain paramount. This is particularly challenging in multi-jurisdictional settings, such as Canada, where health privacy and security requirements are often heterogeneous. Data federation presents a solution to this, allowing for integration and analysis of large datasets from various sites while abiding by local policies. The Canadian Distributed Infrastructure for Genomics platform (CanDIG) enables federated querying and analysis of -omics and health data while keeping that data local and under local control. It builds upon existing infrastructures to connect five health and research institutions across Canada, relies heavily on standards and tooling brought together by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH), implements a clear division of responsibilities among its participants and adheres to international data sharing standards. Participating researchers and clinicians can therefore contribute to and quickly access a critical mass of -omics data across a national network in a manner that takes into account the multi-jurisdictional nature of our privacy and security policies. Through this, CanDIG gives medical and research communities the tools needed to use and analyze the ever-growing amount of -omics data available to them in order to improve our understanding and treatment of various conditions and diseases. CanDIG is being used to make genomic and phenotypic data available for querying across Canada as part of data sharing for five leading pan-Canadian projects including the Terry Fox Comprehensive Cancer Care Centre Consortium Network (TF4CN) and Terry Fox PRecision Oncology For Young peopLE (PROFYLE), and making data from provincial projects such as POG (Personalized Onco- Genomics) more widely available.},

	abstract = {To support human cohort genomic and other “omic” data discovery and analysis across jurisdictions, basic data such as cohort participant age, sex, etc needs to be harmonised. Developing a key “minimal metadata model” of these basic attributes which should be recorded with all cohorts is critical to aid initial querying across jurisdictions for suitable dataset discovery. We describe here the creation of a minimal metadata model, the specific methods used to create the minimal metadata model, and this model’s utility and impact. A first version of the metadata model was built based on a review of Maelstrom research data standards and a manual survey of cohort data dictionaries, which identified and incorporated overlapping core variables across CINECA cohorts. The model was then converted to Genomics Cohorts Knowledge Ontology (GECKO) format and further expanded with additional terms. The minimal metadata model is being made broadly available to aid any project or projects, including those outside of CINECA interested in facilitating cross-jurisdictional data discovery and analysis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The current and future applications of genomic data may raise ethical and privacy concerns. Processing and storing of this data introduce a risk of abuse by potential offenders since the human genome contains sensitive personal information. For this reason, we have developed a privacy-preserving method, named Varlock providing secure storage of sequenced genomic data. We used a public set of population allele frequencies to mask the personal alleles detected in genomic reads. Each personal allele described by the public set is masked by a randomly selected population allele with respect to its frequency. Masked alleles are preserved in an encrypted confidential file that can be shared in whole or in part using public-key cryptography. RESULTS: Our method masked the personal variants and introduced new variants detected in a personal masked genome. Alternative alleles with lower population frequency were masked and introduced more often. We performed a joint PCA analysis of personal and masked VCFs, showing that the VCFs between the two groups cannot be trivially mapped. Moreover, the method is reversible and personal alleles in specific genomic regions can be unmasked on demand. CONCLUSION: Our method masks personal alleles within genomic reads while preserving valuable non-sensitive properties of sequenced DNA fragments for further research. Personal alleles in the desired genomic regions may be restored and shared with patients, clinics, and researchers. We suggest that the method can provide an additional security layer for storing and sharing of the raw aligned reads. © 2021. The Author(s).},

	abstract = {e18094 Background: Gen3 is an open source software platform for developing and operating data commons. Gen3 systems are now used by a variety of institutions and agencies to share and analyze large biomedical datasets including clinical and genomic data. One of the challenges of working with these datasets is disparate clinical data standards used by researchers across different studies and fields. We have worked to address these hurdles in a variety of ways. Methods: Gen3 is an open source software platform for developing and operating data commons. Detailed specification and features can be found at https://gen3.org/ with code located on GitHub ( https://github.com/UC-cdis ). Results: The Gen3 data model is a graphical representation of the different nodes or classes of data that have been collected. Examples include diagnosis, demographic, exposure, and family history. The properties and values on each node are controlled by the data dictionary specified by the data commons creator. While each commons may have a unique data model and dictionary, specifying external standards allows for easier submission of new data and assists data consumers with interpretation of results. A variety of external references can be supported, but here we demonstrate the use of the National Cancer Institute Thesaurus (NCIt). NCIt provides reference terminologies and biomedical standards that contain a rich set of terms, codes, definitions, and concepts. Using the same reference standards across commons allows for the export of clinical data between commons. The Portable Format for Biomedical Data (PFB) was created to facilitate data export and to allow the data dictionary schema as well as the raw data to be compressed and exported. This new file format, which utilizes an Avro serialization, is small, fast, easy to modify, and enables simple data export and import. PFB also has the ability to house entire external reference ontologies and it is easy to update the PFB references as changes are introduced. Conclusions: We have shown here how the Gen3 data model, use of external reference standards for clinical data, and the export/import format of PFB enable the harmonization of clinical data across different data commons.},

With the development of various bioinformatics applications, maintaining the productivity of research, managing human genome data, and analyzing downstream data is essential. This review aims to guide struggling researchers to process and analyze these large-scale genomic data to extract relevant information for improved downstream analyses. Here, we discuss worldwide human genome projects that could be integrated into any data for improved analysis. Obtaining human whole-genome sequencing data from both data stores and processes is costly; therefore, we focus on the development of data format and software that manipulate whole-genome sequencing. Once the sequencing is complete and its format and data processing tools are selected, a computational platform is required. For the platform, we describe a multi-cloud strategy that balances between cost, performance, and customizability. A good quality published research relies on data reproducibility to ensure quality results, reusability for applications to other datasets, as well as scalability for the future increase of datasets. To solve these, we describe several key technologies developed in computer science, including workflow engine. We also discuss the ethical guidelines inevitable for human genomic data analysis that differ from model organisms. Finally, the future ideal perspective of data processing and analysis is summarized.},

Novel biomarkers are needed for improved risk stratification and primary prevention. To assess for independent associations between plasma metabolites and specific CAD plaque phenotypes we performed liquid chromatography mass-spectrometry on plasma from 1002 patients in the BioHEART-CT study. Four metabolites were examined as candidate biomarkers. Dimethylguanidino valerate (DMGV) was associated with presence and amount of CAD (OR) 1.41 (95\% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.12-1.79, p = 0.004), calcified plaque, and obstructive CAD (p {\textless} 0.05 for both). The association with amount of plaque remained after adjustment for traditional risk factors, ß-coefficient 0.17 (95\% CI 0.02-0.32, p = 0.026). Glutamate was associated with the presence of non-calcified plaque, OR 1.48 (95\% CI 1.09-2.01, p = 0.011). Phenylalanine was associated with amount of CAD, ß-coefficient 0.33 (95\% CI 0.04-0.62, p = 0.025), amount of calcified plaque, (ß-coefficient 0.88, 95\% CI 0.23-1.53, p = 0.008), and obstructive CAD, OR 1.84 (95\% CI 1.01-3.31, p = 0.046). Trimethylamine N-oxide was negatively associated non-calcified plaque OR 0.72 (95\% CI 0.53-0.97, p = 0.029) and the association remained when adjusted for traditional risk factors. In targeted metabolomic analyses including 53 known metabolites and controlling for a 5\% false discovery rate, DMGV was strongly associated with the presence of calcified plaque, OR 1.59 (95\% CI 1.26-2.01, p = 0.006), obstructive CAD, OR 2.33 (95\% CI 1.59-3.43, p = 0.0009), and amount of CAD, ß-coefficient 0.3 (95\% CI 0.14-0.45, p = 0.014). In multivariate analyses the lipid and nucleotide metabolic pathways were both associated with the presence of CAD, after adjustment for traditional risk factors. We report novel associations between CAD plaque phenotypes and four metabolites previously associated with CAD. We also identified two metabolic pathways strongly associated with CAD, independent of traditional risk factors. These pathways warrant further investigation at both a biomarker and mechanistic level.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus increases the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality. The relationship between milder elevations of blood glucose and mortality is less clear. This study investigated whether impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance, as well as diabetes mellitus, increase the risk of all-cause and CVD mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 1999 to 2000, glucose tolerance status was determined in 10,428 participants of the Australian Diabetes, Obesity, and Lifestyle Study (AusDiab). After a median follow-up of 5.2 years, 298 deaths occurred (88 CVD deaths). Compared with those with normal glucose tolerance, the adjusted all-cause mortality hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for known diabetes mellitus and newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus were 2.3 (1.6 to 3.2) and 1.3 (0.9 to 2.0), respectively. The risk of death was also increased in those with impaired fasting glucose (HR 1.6, 95\% CI 1.0 to 2.4) and impaired glucose tolerance (HR 1.5, 95\% CI 1.1 to 2.0). Sixty-five percent of all those who died of CVD had known diabetes mellitus, newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus, impaired fasting glucose, or impaired glucose tolerance at baseline. Known diabetes mellitus (HR 2.6, 95\% CI 1.4 to 4.7) and impaired fasting glucose (HR 2.5, 95\% CI 1.2 to 5.1) were independent predictors for CVD mortality after adjustment for age, sex, and other traditional CVD risk factors, but impaired glucose tolerance was not (HR 1.2, 95\% CI 0.7 to 2.2). CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasizes the strong association between abnormal glucose metabolism and mortality, and it suggests that this condition contributes to a large number of CVD deaths in the general population. CVD prevention may be warranted in people with all categories of abnormal glucose metabolism.},
