### GitHub Issues

If you find an error, bug or mistake, please [make a GitHub issue](https://github.com/AustralianBioCommons/human-omics-data-sharing-field-guide/issues/new) detailing the problem and we will do our best fix it as soon as we can. This can also be done by clicking the `!` symbol next to the title of any page.

### GitHub Pull Request

If you would like to contribute a section or some text or fix an error yourself, please fork and create a pull request and we will review and incorporate as soon as we can. 

This can be done by clicking the pencil symbol next to the title of any page, you will be taken to the page on github where you can again click the pencil symbol, make your changes then create a pull request for review.

For more complex changes or addition of new pages, you may find it easier to fork the repo then clone to your local machine and make changes locally before pushing back to GitHub and creating a pull request.

Thanks for your contribution!

## Editing the website:

The [documentation website](https://elixir-belgium.github.io/elixir-toolkit-theme/) to the ELIXIR toolkit theme is a great place to start to find useful information about how to configure this website. While developing the website we found some gaps and have created the following guides to give more detailed configuration information and walk-throughs.

For detailed information on how to configure, edit and add to the site, please see the following guides:
