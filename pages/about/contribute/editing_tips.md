### Editing the config file

A lot of the aspects of the website are changed by editing the `_config.yml` file. The [ELIXIR Toolkit Theme](https://elixir-belgium.github.io/elixir-toolkit-theme/configuring_theme) website has more detailed documentation and details the options available.

### Editing styling

The files that determine the overall styling of the pages are found in the `_sass` folder. Here you can define custom styles, colours, sizes etc.

### Copying other styles

Looking at other websites using this theme is a great way to learn how to implement certain features and styles, [see the list](https://elixir-belgium.github.io/elixir-toolkit-theme/#this-theme-is-known-to-be-used-in) on the ELIXIR toolkit theme website for a list of websites using the theme.

### Getting Help

Any issues with the theme itself can be raised with the ELIXIR Toolkit theme team by [raising an issue](https://elixir-belgium.github.io/elixir-toolkit-theme/configuring_theme) on their GitHub repo. You can also search through previous issues to see if anyone else has had similar issues and found a solution.
