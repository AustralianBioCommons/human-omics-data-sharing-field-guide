## Description

[BioGrid](https://www.biogrid.org.au/) serves 41 member organisations, spanning medical research institutes, universities, government health departments and hospitals. Their strength lies in bringing together datasets from each of these organisations, into a secure platform, and linking the information across the different sources. This enables a researcher to get access to a wealth of different data sources and understand how they link to a particular individual. The data is linked in a secure way so that no identifying information is ever released back to the researchers. The type of data is usually from clinical and government sources. It is possible to see how many patients are shared across databases by using their [matching matrix](https://www.biogrid.org.au/matching-matrix) service.

When researchers want to apply, the process is also more streamlined due to the existing legal, ethical, consent and access frameworks that have been set up by BioGrid. Researchers can put in a single application to a number of different data sources. The data custodian for each source is able to view the application and decide whether they would like to release the data. Researchers will need to have human ethics approval for their research but can apply directly to the BioGrid HREC for a much more streamlined experience.

BioGrid Australia is a not-for-profit company owned by the Australian medical research sector. It enables Principal Investigators, researchers and clinicians to link, join, manipulate and display ethically gathered data. Currently there are 41 member organisations.
