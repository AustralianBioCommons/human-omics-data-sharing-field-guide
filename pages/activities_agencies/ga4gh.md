The Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) {% cite rehm_ga4gh_2021 %} is an international standards development organisation that works collaboratively to enable the responsible, voluntary, and secure sharing of human genomic and health-related data.

GA4GH brings together a global community of stakeholders, including researchers, clinicians, ethicists,  policymakers, and technical experts to co-develop interoperable technical standards and policy frameworks. These frameworks are designed to facilitate data sharing across countries and systems in ways that are ethically robust and technically sound.

Key challenges being tackled relate to data fragmentation, ethical use, and governance by developing solutions such as APIs, schemas, security models, and data access policies. GA4GH products are intended to be modular and adaptable, enabling real-world implementation across diverse contexts, including research infrastructures, clinical settings, and biobanks.

GA4GH plays a foundational role in enabling federated data sharing, empowering researchers and clinicians to access and use data that remains in local environments but is discoverable and queryable across networks. This is particularly important for advancing precision medicine, rare disease research, and international collaborations.

By promoting data standards and harmonisation, GA4GH lowers the barrier for institutions and nations to participate in genomic data sharing initiatives, and aligns with global best efforts to maximise the societal benefits of genomics.

## GA4GH Community
The community is open to anyone to [become involved](https://www.ga4gh.org/get-involved/) in or provide feedback on standards.

Working groups have varied meeting schedules. Hybrid working meetings, known as 'Connect' meetings, are held twice a year. A plenary meeting is held annually which gives a good overview of all the current activities across the organisation. Recordings of these events are put on their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/GA4GH).
