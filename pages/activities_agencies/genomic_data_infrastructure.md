description: The European Genomic Data Infrastructure aims to build infrastructure to enable access to genomic and related phenotypic and clinical data across Europe.
---

The European Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI) is a large-scale, cross-border initiative funded by the European Union to advance the secure, federated sharing and analysis of human genomic and clinical data across Europe.

GDI is building the infrastructure necessary to connect national genomic initiatives and health systems into a cohesive, pan-European ecosystem. The project is coordinated by ELIXIR and engages over 20 countries to support implementation of the 1+Million Genomes (1+MG) initiative.

By fostering technical and policy interoperability, GDI enables data to remain securely within national borders while allowing controlled access for research and healthcare purposes. This federated model supports population-scale genomics while respecting national regulations and the privacy of individuals.

GDI delivers essential building blocks, such as authentication and authorisation systems, data discovery portals, and common metadata standards, that empower European countries to contribute to and benefit from transnational genomics research. The infrastructure is designed to support use cases ranging from rare disease diagnostics to cancer research and pandemic preparedness.

The initiative strengthens Europeâ€™s strategic autonomy in health data, accelerates the development of personalised medicine, and ensures alignment with ethical and legal frameworks such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
