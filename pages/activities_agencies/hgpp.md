## Project Description

{% include image.html file="/diagrams/hgpp-project-overview-diagram.png" caption="Figure 1. A Researcher's journey when discovering, accessing and analysing human genomics data." alt="HGPP Researcher User Journey" max-width="10" %}

A researcher looking for Human Genomics research data to analyse needs to go through a complex multi-step process in order to gain access to the data they need. First they need to find data that is of interest to their research, meeting certain criteria for phenotype, demographics or clinical information. Currently, there is no unified way to do this so researchers need to search through multiple data and publication repositories and try to bring together data from many different sources. 

Due to the sensitive nature of human genomics data, researchers need to prove their identity as a bona fide researcher in order access detailed information in repositories. Currently, this is largely isolated to each different repository, meaning users need to register independently and keep track of their various identities. It also makes it difficult for the owners of the service to verify the identity of each user as bona fide researchers.

Once they find data of interest, they often need to request access through a data access committee (DAC). This is often an ad-hoc manual process that involves back and forth emails between the data requester, data custodians, data administrators and data access committee members. The ad-hoc manual nature makes it difficult to track, audit and report on at a later date.

After their request is approved through the DAC, a research will often then need to retrieve the data from a repository or archive. In Australia, there are no national archives, so this often means downloading large data files from North America or Europe which can be time-consuming and prone to drop-outs.

The HGPP seeeks to improve this researcher journey by discovering and testing the best global technologies and laying the foundation to implement them at a national scale in the five sub-project areas:

- **Virtual Cohorts** -  Discovering and assembling cohorts of interest across multiple repositories
- **Data Access Committee Support** - Implementing DAC management software to streamline data access requests and approvals
- **Federated Identity & Access Management** -  Establishing trusted identities linked to institutional accounts that can be used for national genomic services and resources
- **Data & Metadata Archiving** - Investigating the feasibility of establishing a national human genomics archive in Australia
- **Communications, Documentation & Training** - Ensuring all implemented solutions are communicated and there is support to use them

## Knowledge discovery

Requirements gathering
User Needs
Identifying Gaps and pilot solutions
Deciding on pilot to implement and assess

## Pilot implementations

After knowledge gathering we proceeded with testing out pilot solutions for each sub-project as shown below.

The findings from this pilot phase are summarised in the [pilot implementation reports](#pilot-implementation-reports) for each sub-project
