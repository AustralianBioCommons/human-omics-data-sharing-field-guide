Australian Genomics holds data from [15 flagship studies](https://www.australiangenomics.org.au/tools-and-resources/accessing-australian-genomics-data/). The data is controlled access and must be applied for. Data doesnâ€™t follow any single standard but details about what clinical information was collected in each study is available via their website. Data access is managed under their [data access and sharing for secondary use policy](https://www.australiangenomics.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Australian-Genomics_Data-Access-Policy_20220607.pdf) and applicants must agree to their [data access and sharing agreement](https://www.australiangenomics.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Data-Access-and-Sharing-Agreement-V3.0_20210816_plus_DAR.pdf). Access and distribution of data is currently managed by the University of Melbourne Centre for Cancer Research ([UMCCR](https://mdhs.unimelb.edu.au/centre-for-cancer-research)). Users with access can also explore variants via the [VariantAtlas](https://variantatlas.org.au/).
