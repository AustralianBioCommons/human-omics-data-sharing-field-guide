The Database of Genotypes And Phenotypes (dbGAP) is a controlled access archive for human datasets [(Tryka et al. 2014)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?etEDEc). It is managed by NCBI in the USA. Access control is managed through a central DAC based on data access policy. Data files may reside in their central data storage or be accessed from through other portals e.g. [Kids First](https://portal.kidsfirstdrc.org/login) or [GDC data portal](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/).

Access is determined at the project level and there is little required metadata.

The study needs to be funded by NIH or needs to go through an [approvals process](https://sharing.nih.gov/genomic-data-sharing-policy/submitting-genomic-data/how-to-submit-a-non-nih-funded-study-to-dbgap).
