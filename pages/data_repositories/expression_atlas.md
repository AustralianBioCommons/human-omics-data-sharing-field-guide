The Expression Atlas is a tool to explore gene and protein expression information across a range of species [(Moreno et al. 2022)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?DOCYdy). Data are processed through standardised pipelines and presented as interactive visualisations. There is also a specific [single-cell expression atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/home). Data often comes into the expression atlas from ArrayExpress.
