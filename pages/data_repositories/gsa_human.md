The Genome Sequence Archive for Human (GSA-Human) is a controlled access repository run by the China National Centre for Bioinformatics and National Genomics Data Center [(Chen et al. 2021)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?EKVoTz). Follows a similar model to the EGA where the data submitter remains the custodian of the data and must organise their own DAC to respond to data access requests [(CNCB-NGDC n.d.; Chen et al. 2021)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?NIs63m). They will accept data from researchers globally and focus on raw sequencing data [(Chen et al. 2021)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?qiuRVL).
