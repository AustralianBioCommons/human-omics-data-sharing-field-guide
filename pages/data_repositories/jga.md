Japanese Genotype-Phenotype Archive (JGA) is a controlled access repository run by the National Bioscience Database Center (NBDC) and Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) [(Okido et al. 2022)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?Q3ToQd). It stores de-identified human data from studies [approved by JST-NBDC](https://humandbs.biosciencedbc.jp/en/data-submission). The JGA has a central [Data Access Committee](https://biosciencedbc.jp/en/about-us/organization/dac/) that makes decisions on who can access data within the system. Access is given based on an entire dataset and can be downloaded by the requestor if approved.
