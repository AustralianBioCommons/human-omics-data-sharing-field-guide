The Australian Constitution does not specifically cover privacy, healthcare and medical research. This means that the legal landscape relating to genomic data sharing in Australia is a complex patchwork of federal, state and territory laws in combination with ethical guidelines and codes of practice. {% cite eckstein_australia_2018 %} Questions of jurisdiction of state and federal legislation are complex, especially in modern research environments that are often multi-regional and multi-national.

## Consent

According to the National Statement consent may be for a specific research project, extended for similar related research in the future, or unspecified allowing for any future research. Waivers of consent may also be granted by a HREC in circumstances where consent may be impracticable to obtain or there are no known or likely reasons why someone would otherwise object to giving consent. The National Statement says that specific consent is not needed when the data was aggregated or rendered non-identifiable, or if prior consent was given for an encompassing research project or clinical context for research. HRECs may require community or group consent in addition to individual consents for genomic research involving Indigenous Australians. {% cite eckstein_australia_2018 %}

## Human Research Ethics Committees

HRECs have oversight of research proposals that involve human participants to ensure that they meet ethical standards and guidelines. Approximately 200 HRECs are registered with the [NHMRC](https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/research-policy/ethics/human-research-ethics-committees). 

## National statement on Ethical Conduct

The main ethical code covering sharing of human genomic information for research is the National Statement for Ethical Conduct in Human Research (2007) (Australian Government National Health and Medical Research Council 2007) (2018) {% cite nhmrc_national_2018 %}. Compliance with this ethical code is not a legal requirement in Australia. But institutions may only apply for funding from the NHMRC if they declare that all their research complies with the National Statement. Failure to meet the requirements of the National Statement could have repercussions for employment, professional misconduct claims or even an action in the tort of negligence. It is a guiding principle of the statement that participation in research must be voluntary and participants must be well informed about the research and its implications. Researchers who share genomic data must try to minimise the likelihood of re-identifying individuals from the data.

Chapters 2.2 and 2.3 of the National Statement deal with consent and qualifiers and waivers of consent. Chapter 3.3 deals with genomic data. Chapter 4.7 addresses considerations related to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.

## The *Privacy act*

Consent is usually required for genomic information meeting the definition of personal information as defined under Australian privacy laws. The federal public sector and private corporations are bound by the *Privacy Act* 1988 {% cite ag_privacy_2022 oaic_privacy_2022 %}(Commonwealth). Similarly most states and territories also have their own privacy legislation. In the federal legislation personal information must not be disclosed by a regulated entity beyond its original purpose for collection, unless a person has consented to the disclosure or exemptions apply. Exemptions allowing disclosure without consent include research with an impact on public health and safety and circumstances where the research cannot proceed without the use of de-identified data. The *Privacy Act* does not say whether genomic sequencing data on its own constitutes personal information, and this has not been tested in court. 

A recent publication by Paltiel, Taylor and Newson {% cite paltiel_protection_2023 %} provides a deeper discussion of when genomic data may or may not be considered 'personal information' and protected under the *Privacy Act*. The context of the data and how it may contribute to the reasonable identifiability is important to understanding whether the *Privacy Act* applies to such data {% cite paltiel_protection_2023 %}.
