According to the National Statement consent may be for a specific research project, extended for similar related research in the future, or unspecified allowing for any future research. Waivers of consent may also be granted by a HREC in circumstances where consent may be impracticable to obtain or there are no known or likely reasons why someone would otherwise object to giving consent. The National Statement says that specific consent is not needed when the data was aggregated or rendered non-identifiable, or if prior consent was given for an encompassing research project or clinical context for research. HRECs may require community or group consent in addition to individual consents for genomic research involving Indigenous Australians. (Eckstein et al. 2018)
