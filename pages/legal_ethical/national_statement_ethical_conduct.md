The main ethical code covering sharing of human genomic information for research is the
National Statement for Ethical Conduct in Human Research (2007) (Australian Government National Health and Medical Research Council 2007) (2018) (the National Statement). Compliance with this ethical code is not a legal requirement in Australia. But institutions may only apply for funding from the NHMRC if they declare that all their research complies with the National Statement. Failure to meet the requirements of the National Statement could have repercussions for employment, professional misconduct claims or even an action in the tort of negligence. It is a guiding principle of the statement that participation in research must be voluntary and participants must be well informed about the research and its implications. Researchers who share genomic data must try to minimise the likelihood of re-identifying individuals from the data.

Chapters 2.2 and 2.3 of the National Statement deal with consent and qualifiers and waivers of consent. Chapter 3.3 deals with genomic data. Chapter 4.7 addresses considerations related to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.
