Consent is usually required for genomic information meeting the definition of personal information as defined under Australian privacy laws. The federal public sector and private corporations are bound by the Privacy Act 1988 (Commonwealth). Similarly most states and territories also have their own privacy legislation. In the federal legislation personal information must not be disclosed by a regulated entity beyond its original purpose for collection, unless a person has consented to the disclosure or exemptions apply. Exemptions allowing disclosure without consent include research with an impact on public health and safety and circumstances where the research cannot proceed without the use of de-identified data. The privacy act does not say whether genomic sequencing data on its own constitutes personal information, and this has not been tested in court.
