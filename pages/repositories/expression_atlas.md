The [Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/home) is a tool to explore gene and protein expression information across a range of species {% cite moreno_expression_2022 %}. Data are processed through standardised pipelines and presented as interactive visualisations. There is also a specific [single-cell expression atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/home). Data often comes into the expression atlas from ArrayExpress.
