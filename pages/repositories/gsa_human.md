The Genome Sequence Archive for Human ([GSA-Human](https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gsa-human/)) is a controlled access repository run by the China National Centre for Bioinformatics and National Genomics Data Center {% cite chen_genome_2021 %}. Follows a similar model to the EGA where the data submitter remains the custodian of the data and must organise their own DAC to respond to data access requests {% cite cncb-ngdc_database_2022 chen_genome_2021 %} . They will accept data from researchers globally and focus on raw sequencing data {% cite chen_genome_2021 %}.
