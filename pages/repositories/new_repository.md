When a submission gets made to any of the INSDC or CNCB GSA databases, project related information gets stored within a ‘BioProject’ object which gets linked to the genome sequence submission. All information is open access and mirrored across INSDC databases, with the CNCB GSA database also mirroring what is in the INSDC databases but not the other way around.
