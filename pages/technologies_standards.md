Storage, sharing and analytics of human omics data involves a large ecosystem of technolgies and standards, including:

* Data commons platforms that allow groups to manage, analyze and share omics data, searchable using key clinical and demographic variables.
* User identity and authentication mechanisms for establishing trust and assigning permissions.
* Computational workflow systems for orchestrating large scale distributed computations within secure computing environments.
* File format specifications for different data types.
* Protocols for querying datasets held across multiple organisations to assemble cohorts for further research, and for sending data between systems.
* Language ontologies for establishing standard nomenclature and compatible representations of data and metadata.
