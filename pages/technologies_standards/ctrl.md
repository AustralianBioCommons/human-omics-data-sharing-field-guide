CTRL {% cite "haas_ctrl_2021" %} is an open-source, web-based platform that enables participants to give dynamic consent for how and where their genomic test results are used.

The software can be customised to a project's needs and integrated with external databases, such as [REDCap](https://www.project-redcap.org/), using bi-directional APIs that can push and pull data between the resources.
