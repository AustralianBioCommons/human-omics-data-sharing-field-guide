## What is Globus?

Globus is like a digital postal service for scientists, helping researchers safely and quickly move large amounts of data between computers, universities, and labs worldwide. Developed by the University of Chicago, this free, sophisticated file-sharing platform is designed specifically for scientific research, solving the problem of sharing massive data files that are too big for email or regular cloud storage [1](https://www.globus.org/what-we-do). Instead of mailing hard drives or waiting days for uploads, researchers can use Globus to transfer terabytes of data in hours, making the movement of enormous datasets—such as brain scans, weather models, or genetic sequences—almost as easy as sending an email.

## Key Features and How It Works

The platform enables secure collaboration by allowing researchers to safely share sensitive data with colleagues at other institutions while maintaining strict privacy controls. Labs can also automate data transfers, so when equipment like DNA sequencers finish analyzing samples, results are automatically sent to the appropriate researchers. The usage process is straightforward: researchers log in using their university credentials, select files for transfer, choose a destination, start the transfer, and receive notifications when complete.

## Transforming Human Genomics Research

Globus has become essential in human genomics for moving huge sequencing datasets—often several terabytes per experiment—quickly and securely between sequencers, computing clusters, and archives. The University of Michigan exemplifies this transformation, using Globus to automate transfers of 6 TB runs while ensuring data integrity and compliance with privacy standards like HIPAA. Before implementing Globus, their genetics lab produced 6 terabytes of genetic information every few days but faced weeks-long delays as researchers waited for data delivery through mailed hard drives, with occasional data loss or corruption [2](https://www.globus.org/user-stories/genomic-researchers-umichigan).

After adopting Globus, data delivery time dropped from weeks to hours, they achieved zero security breaches over three years, and international collaborations became routine. For instance, they successfully transferred 3 terabytes of genetic data to New Zealand researchers in just three hours—something that would have taken weeks using traditional methods. At the University of Washington, combining Globus with cloud resources cut exome processing time from 24 to 2.5 hours, demonstrating how the platform streamlines and secures large-scale genomic workflows.

## Considerations and Impact

While Globus excels at large-scale data transfer, it's not ideal for small files where regular email or Google Drive work better. Institutions need to install the software first, and users require some training, though it's simpler than alternatives. Despite these minor limitations, Globus democratizes science by making it easy for researchers everywhere to collaborate, regardless of their technical expertise or institutional resources. It functions like a universal translator for scientific data, enabling discoveries that wouldn't be possible if researchers were isolated in their own data silos. In essence, Globus removes the technical barriers that often slow down scientific progress, allowing researchers to focus on making discoveries rather than fighting with file transfers.
