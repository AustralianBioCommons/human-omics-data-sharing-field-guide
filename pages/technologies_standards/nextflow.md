## What is Nextflow?

Nextflow is an open-source workflow management system that enables the development and execution of computational pipelines for scientific and data analysis. The need for this tool is becoming increasingly prevalent with the rise of big data and the growing demand for capability to perform analysis on these large datasets (see [here](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/overview.html) for more information). Nextflow is particularly useful in the fields of genomics and bioinformatics for its ability to streamline complex data analyses.

### Key features

- **Portability**: Operates across different computing environments e.g. local machines, high-performance computing clusters, and cloud platforms (like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure)

- **Scalability**: Easily scales from local to large computing setups by enabling modular and parallel execution of processes, dynamically scaling resources based on workload and environment and allowing workflows to leverage large-scale compute resources without manual intervention.

- **Reproducibility**: Promotes reproducible research by tracking data and processes, and encouraging community contributions, allowing researchers to reuse and adapt existing workflows easily.

- **Integration**: Supports various programming languages and tools commonly used in bioinformatics and data science e.g. container technologies, cloud services and job schedulers. Nextflow also provides APIs for integration with other tools and systems, enabling custom extensions and enhancements to workflows.
